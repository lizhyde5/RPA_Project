David Archy Men's 4 Pack Micro Modal Lightweight Sexy Bikinis and Briefs,Apparel,5,1,2,N,Y,Perfect hot & humid summer underwear,"I normally prefer to go commando in the summertime but for work, when I'm wearing dress pants and a dress shirt, it's not quite so feasible. In colder temps I'll happily wear boxers and in freezing cold long johns, but I really hate the traditional cotton briefs (a.k.a. &#34;tighty whiteys&#34;) as well as their skimpier cotton &#34;bikini&#34; versions.<br /><br />Had never heard of &#34;David Archy&#34; before, but these undies got my attention because of all the glowing reviews here on Amazon, and the description of the material, as well as curiosity about a penis-pouch...a feature I've never had in any of my underwear before. Plus the price wasn't as crazy as some of the others (cough cough, Calvin Klein!).<br /><br />Well, tried them out as soon as they arrived, and a couple hours later, have to say that I am most pleased! The material is soft and breathable not constricting or scratchy like the typical Hanes/Fruit-of-the-Loom or the ridiculously overprice Calvin Kleins. And that pouch, goofy-looking as it is, definitely gets the job done: provides impeccable support and comfort! Yeah I admit I would feel pretty sheepish if I were caught dead in say, a crowded gym's changing room wearing this thing, but I usually put on my gym clothes before heading out the door anyways so that's not an issue.<br /><br />My only concern with this product is long-term durability of the fabric. Have never seen briefs come in individual cardboard containers within a multi-pack, each with its own packet of dessicant beads! And then there's the care instructions on the ridiculously long rear tag (which I promptly scissored off of course): &#34;Machine Wash Cold. Wash with like colors. Tumble dry low. Cool iron. Do not wring. Do not dry clean.&#34; (Who in the world would think of ironing or dry cleaning their briefs???)<br /><br />So, will keep my fingers crossed that the material is not overly delicate. Since I plan to wear them for only a month or two out of the year, that should not be too big of a deal.<br /><br />PS. It's hilarious how many guys are using their Amazon reviews to shamelessly flaunt their stuff in the photos...is Amazon becoming a meat market pickup joint these days? lolshould not be too big of a deal.<br /><br />PS.

i play. Baby & Toddler Girls' Rashguard Set with Built-In Absorbent Swim Diaper,Apparel,4,1,1,N,Y,Sizing question mark,This suit fit my baby well and was very durable.<br />I could ask for few minor improvements such as the little design in the middle came off after couple of months of use. Also the bottoms fit tight (which is good as a bathing suit) but hard to put on a baby. I wish there was another option with side closure or something to make it easier to put on and take off.<br /><br />Another thing is the sizing but it may be due to the heat and sun that it stretches.<br />I had purchased a SMALL size when my baby was about 3-months. Now she is 15-months and I purchased the next size. But when we looked at the MEDIUM we received it was clearly smaller than the SMALL we had. We lived in Borneo which is hot and humid all year round. So the heat and sun might have caused the material to stretch but I was a bit confused to see that the new MEDIUM was smaller than my old SMALL.,6/24/2014,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Genuine Leather Trench Coat w/Double breast button closure and belt,Apparel,1,14,16,N,N,This Trench Coat Is NOT Made From REAL leather,"I foolishly purchased 2 of these so-called \\""leather\\"" trench coats on eBay in December 2011; same manufacturer lable (i.e., Giovanni Navarre) except these were size 3XL. After paying about $90 in tailor's fees, when I picked up the coat, the tailor told me that this was not a leather coat, but rather a Chinese imitation of leather. What each purchaser will find out, is that after wearing these coats for 2-3 weeks, and perhaps folding the coat, that the black finish of the coat will start to crack, particularly in the areas of the coat that are bent the most while wearing it (e.g., the arm-shoulder area, the elbows), and will then break/peel off exposing a white, heavy woven-fabric substrate beneath. The slightly elastic, black \\""leather\\"" coating applied to the woven-fabric substrate appears to be some sort of polymeric finish. After reading one of he earlier reviews from another buyer, I asked my tailor why this coat had so much stitching on it so as to make it appear to be made from sewn-together pieces of leather. His response was that this specifically was done to stabilize each sewn coated area from excess movement so as to keep the polymeric finish on the coat. Said he, \\""If you know leather like I do, you can tell just from the feel of this garment that it is NOT leather.\\"" I've been using a balck magic marker to stain the peeled-off coat areas black again and the coat looks horrible.",8/30/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I had to wear black undergarments without lines because the lighter color fabric is revealing. I will have to line it with some fabric the next time.

I have two of these: one in blue and one in red (more of a brick-red). Pockets are nice and deep. Fabric is light weight and nice for summer, sort-of a gauze material that requires something under it. But nice for summer layering. This brand is extremely inconsistent. Even with the two dresses, one has an oddly long button placket. The biggest drawback is that one arrived with a sickly-sweet smell. I've washed this twice, the second time with Lysol and scented washing liquid, but the rotten candy smell persists. I am trying scented dryer sheets with copious amounts of fabric odor-neutralizer.

I ended up returning it though, because the high gore was very irritating and gave me rash. Also, I didn't really like texture of the straps, they were not very nice looking and were difficult to adjust.<br /><br />I also wanted to add that Amazon, or whoever packs these bras needs to be more careful, this bra was very wrinkled when I received it and while the outside looked smooth, there were a lot of creases in the inside molding and those can be permanent.",6/21/2013,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Half Slip, Sand18-S",Apparel,4,10,11,N,Y,Great slip for price,"For the price, this slip is awesome. I checked out some slips at Target and the ones at Target felt slightly nicer but they were more than twice the price. I ended up ordering the ones on Amazon because I like the thick lace hem (I think it's sexy) but it's the lace hem that I also took off one star. It has a funny scallop design in the back (I wish the back was the same as the front or that there were a picture of the back so I knew before I ordered it) because the scalloped part makes it really obvious that it's \\""underwear\\"" and not nice looking when it peeks out through a slit of dress or skirt. The slip is also relatively \\""high waist-ed\\"" so it doesn't work for some of my skirts meant to be worn around the hip (I can't just pull it down because then it's too long/longer than my skirts). Also, I felt shipping was a bit high considering it's so light and small but I bought four slips at once so that made it more reasonable. The sand looked more like a pale yellow than the pinkish beige in the picture but it's a beautiful color and I love it.",7/27/2009,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

eShakti Women's Tipped trim shift dress,Apparel,1,7,8,N,N,Don't do it!,"I was so excited to find eShakti a few months back...customized clothes in a range of sizes sound great, right? So, so wrong! I ordered a bunch of items, including a dress like this one. Everything went back because everything was very poorly made. Nothing fit well and the fabrics felt cheap. The clothes all felt like some sort of high school home ec project. So of course I have to pay to return everything. And when they were way late in processing the return, I emailed customer service and got no response. I called, and they have one of those automated messages, that after about 30 seconds, goes to \\""all of our rep are busy, leave a message.\\"" click. I finally get the return processed and I receive a $40 bill from DHL for the US customs charges! According to the voicemail the customer service rep left (because, again, you can't reach a live person when you call), it's noted somewhere on their website that if you order over $200, you'll be charged a fee by US customs for an international purchase. Really? Maybe you want to raise the profile of that bit of info a little. Like, when you basket gets to $200, you're prompted with a screen that says, \\""hey the price of your order is now going to get jacked up 20%, but you won't get the bill until weeks after our poorly-made clothes arrive...are you sure you want to proceed?\\""<br /><br />Honestly - just not worth it.",7/12/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bslingerie Womens Waist Cincher Boned Corset With Brocade,Apparel,3,27,40,N,Y,Fits Small - Boning not strong enough,"This corset worked good for my costume; however the boning in it is not very strong. It dimpled easily and did not hold everything in place as it should. This may work better for women who are slimmer. I would suggest ordering 3-4 sizes larger. (ie I wear an XL tshirt - and a XXXL was still too small.)<br /><br />The lacing in the back should be about 2-3inches apart, when I put mine on it was more like 6inches. If you are looking for medical grade boning in a corset for something that will last long term, this is not an ideal choice.<br /><br />Also, the ribbon that came with mine was not long enough, I had to purchase more. It only came with one piece, typically in a corset you need 2 - one from top, one from bottom, tie in the middle. This allows for you to adjust as needed. I also found that the clasps in the front were very difficult to get into, causing me to have to unlace from the back first in order to get in/out of the corset.<br /><br />Rule of thumb: when fitting into a corset 2-3inchs apart with the lacing is ideal; double laces in the back helps a lot; if it fits properly, you should not need to ever unlace the back unless you need to adjust the tightness - you should always be able to unclasp or untie from the front to get in/out with ease.<br /><br />I would recommend this for someone who is just looking for a cute corset in a pinch but does not want to spend the money on a more sturdy REAL corset/bodice/waist cincher.",2/27/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Columbia Sandy River Cargo Short,Apparel,5,11,15,N,Y,Great for the beach,"We go to the beach about twice per week, to walk and also to sit and read. I don't wear a swimsuit usually, just old shorts and a tank top. My old cotton cargo shorts have just about worn completely out, so I got this to replace them. Need at least two good sized pockets for my phone and keys. These shorts fit well (I wear an 8 or 10 in most pants/slacks, and I ordered the medium), and are lightweight so that if I do happen to wade into the water, they dry very quickly. I'm sure the nylon fabric will last much longer than the cotton did.<br /><br /> All the seams are tight, no loose threads or apparent weaknesses in the construction. Thirty-four dollars was a bit more than what I wanted to pay, but after visiting two or three local stores without finding anything close to what I was looking for, I quit driving around, bit the bullet and ordered these. I'm glad I did. Now I can spend the time at the beach instead of driving from store to store!",2/28/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The skirt does not look as pictured, she is definitely wearing a petticoat. Since I don't have one, the skirt just limply hangs and barely covers my hoo-ha. I'm sure a small would have had more length, but even an extra small had too much fabric (and I'm not that tiny anyway). I knew for twenty something dollars it was going to look a little cheap, but the only thing that was unexpected and disappointing thing was how the zipper on the back bunches up (again, way too much fabric for an xs).<br /><br />Overall for the price, it's okay.",5/19/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Splendid Women's Tank Maxi Dress,Apparel,1,5,5,N,Y,Feels cheap and looks poorly made,"I was so excited to see this dress available in my size as I've been stalking it online for a while. It looked so great in the photos that I couldn't wait to order it. However, when I received it and tried it on, I couldn't have been more disappointed. While I love the style of the top, particularly the racerback, I found the material to be rather sheer. In addition, the button placket was completely crooked, as if it was intentionally sewn on the diagonal. The dress looked like an outlet piece or a factory second that should have been marked 'irregular.' Also, the skirt is not gathered as it appears in the picture. In fact, there was very little gathering at the junction of the top and the skirt on the dress I received. It might as well be a long sheath dress. Perhaps I don't have the figure to fill out this dress, but it was so ill-fitting, I'm pretty sure a floor-length potato sack would be more flattering. Finally, the skirt's fabric felt cheap and seemed as though it would be prone to wrinkles. I own several Splendid dresses and this one is definitely not up to par. For a dress that was $100+, I expected a whole lot more.",8/25/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleeves are a little long but when tightened up fit fine. Length is good and it has enough room to wear a jacket underneath comfortably. Good, weatherproof material. Seems like it will be warm in the winter. The sleeves and neck have straps that snug up to keep heat in and the wind/snow/rain don't seep in and make you cold.I have not rode in it yet but has enough room it should fit over a saddle nicely. Quality was above expectation but I will see how it wears over time. It is nicer than ones I found at the local western wear store and about half the price. Was nice enough my boyfriend (lifetime cowboy) bought one after seeing mine because he was impressed by the material and price to boot. Not as nice as the super expensive ones but for under $100 you cannot go wrong with it. I would suggest going to downundersaddlesupply.com and looking under the jackets page where they have a sizing chart that makes picking a size so much easier especially for women.",9/9/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here goes! *no regrets*<br /><br />I got it on date promised, and was stunned at how heavy the package was. It looks like a well constructed jacket in the pic and I thought it wouldn't be in person... WRONG! IT IS SUPERB!<br />It came in a sort of ziplock bag that was in a sealed bubble wrap envelope. The bag and the tag says 5XL which made me go HUH!? but the minute I put in my first arm I knew they got itvright! heavy, sturdy, perfectly constructed, looks like I spent a fortune on this thing! The blue is a tad lighter but nothing to be bummed about. It's fully lined too! The only thing is the smell... it has a musky smell as if it was boxed up for some time... nothing a lil airing out can't help... no biggie. I bought a pair of black leather fitted pants to go with this bad boy. Sorry about not posting pics at the moment but I definitely will update with it.<br />Bottom line... go with their US sizing if not sure of Asian size and PURCHASE THE DAM THING!

Brixton Men's Guild Strap Wallet,Apparel,4,1,2,N,Y,Fit for a cowboy or rocker.,"lately all sorts of brands have been making \\""magic band\\"" wallets. hard graft was the first i believe, but at 300 bones, thats pretty steep. they make no brand ones too, but the bands on those tend to stretch out quickly and the leather/pleather on them seem to wear out also, fraying at the corners and edges. there seems to be a trend lately where men dont have the basic fold out wallets. the bifold or the trifold. rvca, makes a decent one, black with a racing stripe on the side. its pretty sharp. black magic band wallets are nice. but for those that want a brown one that doesnt look bad at all, i give you the Brixton Men's Guild Strap wallet. the bands havent stretched out for me yet, and the brown is REALLY nice. its got a cowboy boot feel to the outside, and the grey colored felt inside contrasts with the exterior. why is it felt on the inside? well, if you do happen to get your wallet wet on say, a river rafting ride, normal wallets' bills tend to stick to the wallet. the felt inside keeps the bills from sticking to the wallet, thus making them easy to remove even when wet. on top of that, this wallet also has a custom shaped pocket made just for putting guitar picks in it. great place to hold a spare, when the one you usually stick between three strings on the frets, has gone missing.",5/31/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My baby is definitely under the average curve (but most brands she fits the size of her age). Like most review, the headband is ridiculously small. She fitted the band when she was 3 months old. SO naturally, we don't have that headband to match the dress on her first bday party.",3/1/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is so comfortable that I do not know I have it on. It supports my full figure and I still have a cleavage. The wide hook band on the back gives me more support that keeps the back from riding up. The material is so soft and it lets my skin breath. The straps are not wide, but yet they are very comfortable.<br />I searched this whole year for this same bra because I needed and wanted more of the same kind. My size 34D is hard to find.

WallFlower Plus Size Short Inseam Classic Legendary Bootcut Jeans,Apparel,5,0,0,N,Y,"Feel like actual denim (more cotton than ""stretch"" for once!!)","I ordered these because I love the style and was excited that they have a &#34;short&#34; inseam (hard for my 5'2&#34; self). Was disappointed they were not double button - I'd looked at so many styles I guess I got another pair stuck in my head when I ordered these and somehow thought these had the double button waist... they do not, but are clearly not pictured to have that so it was my mistake I was thrilled when I tried them on and they actually feel like real denim jeans (like you can not find anymore, but how they used to be made in the 90's and before)... I couldn't be happier and will definatley be ordering more. Oh, a note on the &#34;short&#34; inseam... longer than I expected. I am 5'2&#34; and have more torso and less legs than average, My inseam is 30&#34; and these drag on me if I wear them with flip flops or ballet flats. Paired with boots or heels it's fine. I'd estimate the inseam is 31 or 32.",3/19/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am very pale and my nipples are clearly visible through the fabric, without the undershirt.<br />Aside from the sheerness, the dress is lovely.

"Fruit of the Loom Women's Plus Size ""Fit For Me"" 5 Pack Heather Brief Panties",Apparel,2,0,0,N,Y,Over all fit OK,I only wear panties under my night clothes and around the house. I prefer cotton. I recently lost 40lbs and all my panties were stretched out and too big. I ordered new ones in my usual brand in a smaller size. The quality was awful. I shopped around online and found nothing but bad / low rated reviews for cotton panties. Decided to try Fruit of the Loom and one other brand. The other brand fit better then these. In both brands a nice cotton material although a lighter weight then I am used to. After washing the fit over all is not comfy mainly because the leg openings are too large and gap. No elastic in that area. Nice colors and I will wear them for awhile but I will not order this brand again.,4/19/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(I tried on a pair size 6 in a store - fit better but leg length was too short) I am 5&#34;5&#34; but need a 30&#34; inseam. Size 8 is a 29&#34; inseam. These &#34;Skinny&#34; legs are not too tight either if you tend to have bigger legs.

The chains are big and tough, and opening and closing the zippers will require considerable force, which the hook on the slider bow is not capable of withstanding. I would not buy this company's products until they fix this zipper design- it is very poorly engineered.",4/7/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carhartt Men's Quilt Lined Duck Coveralls X01,Apparel,5,2,3,N,Y,"ORDER SEVERAL SIZES UP, I MEAN SEVERAL.","Bought this for my boyfriend as he works in construction. We had NO IDEA how to order it size wise due to all of the feedback left on fitting, my advice READ ALL THE COMMENTS UNTIL YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO DESCRIBES THE SAME PHYSIQUE YOU'RE DRESSING AND ORDER THE SIZE THEY DID! Seriously, I spent about an hour reading but it was well worth it because boy even with our size up guesstimate we were way off. He's just under 6ft about 180lbs. Normally a 32 or 34 waist in pants ( and even that is a bit baggy) so we were going to order a size 38 or 40. Glad I researched, wound up buying a size 46 and it fit perfectly. Seriously, when they say size up, SIZE WAY WAY UP. We probably could have gotten away with a 44 but at least with this he can still fit sweat pants or hoodies and jeans under this for extra layers. Other than that he loves it and I'm much happier knowing he's warm!",2/13/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secret Wishes Star Wars Female Darth Vader Costume,Apparel,4,0,1,N,Y,cute but short in the butt,"I am a size 8-10 and 5'7&#34;. I bought 3 different versions of the same costume (Boba Fett, Darth Vader, and the X-wing Fighter). They all were great except that they didn't account for butts. Mind you, I have no butt. Zip. Zero. It's more like an extension of my back. Even so, I felt like I was always pulling it down. I wore tights and a pair of &#34;cartwheel shorts&#34; underneath to help with this problem. The rest of the fit in the arms and chest and torso were pretty true to size although I would have appreciated it a few inches longer (especially in the rear) so I would have felt a little more comfortable in public with my kids. If your goal is to be super-sexy though, it was a perfect fit.<br /><br />The fabric is a spandex like expected and fairly well constructed but it would have been nice if the belt had another part of the costume to attach to so it would stay in the same place. The dress itself has a low waist so when it rode up due to the butt (or lack thereof) problem, the belt would move too and so it tended to look awkward if I didn't readjust it every 4 min.<br /><br />All in all, it worked and it was a great choice in a sea of &#34;let's see who can be the sexiest person for one night&#34; contests!",11/24/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wacoal Women's Embrace Lace Cupless Shape Camisole,Apparel,4,1,1,N,N,Cute little wardrobe addition,"My boyfriend bought this for me. I think it's adorable. My first thought was \\""omg Minoan bodice!\\"" because I'm kind of a nerd. It's not functional shapewear for me (I'm petite-- I usually wear a size 2 and would hope that I don't really need shapewear), but it's a cute little top that could be worn over something or worn by itself as a sexy little piece (but obviously not out of the house). I think the lace detailing on it is very pretty and it is very form fitting without making me feel like I'm squeezed into it. It does ride up a little bit, as another reviewer mentioned, but it doesn't ride up very far and since I don't use it as shapewear this doesn't really bother me. However, I'm giving it 4 stars because I realize that this might be a problem for people who would consider buying it.",12/14/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Tengs Exclusive 32"" 80cm Spiral Curly Cosplay Costume Wig",Apparel,4,4,4,N,N,"Great wig for the price, looks great","The wig did come as it appears in the picture, purple, vibrant and pretty. I didn't notice a strong smell as some reviewers had complained and was satisfied with how it looked. I bought the wig for a Rarity cosplay I was doing for a 3 day anime convention, and I felt it definitely did the job well. My only complaint was that perhaps due to my having to transport the wig, the humidity of San Antonio, the amount of times the wig was removed and reapplied, or my general ignorance of wigs in general, by the third day the wig was unruly and fizzy. I haven't tried to have it refreshed so I'm unsure if the wig is salvageable. Even frizzy, the wig looks pretty nice it just wasn't as \\""clean\\"" looking at it originally was. Ultimately I'm very satisfied with the wig, and with how quickly it was shipped over, not to mention the affordable price. I would repurchase from this company and seller.",7/21/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had recently signed up to receive their email updates and as a thank-you bonus I was awarded a 50% off discount code. I decided to purchase this Kaito 500 radio. The price I paid was $30.35 and that included shipping. I ordered it on Saturday evening and received it the following Friday morning. The radio was packaged well and when I opened the box I was happy to realize it had been delivered in excellent condition. After plugging the rechargeable battery in per instructions, and cranking the dymo for 1 minute, it powered right up and I was able to tune to my favorite AM station. Although the speaker is small the sound was excellent at a fairly low volume. I flipped to the FM band and that all sounded good too. I haven't tried either SW bands yet but will test those at night. I tested the flashlight and reading light function. Both worked without flaw. I was able to pick up the weather band on channel 1 but it did not pull that broadcast in nearly as good as a smaller weather radio that I have so the weather radio of the Kaito 500 could be much better. The radio comes with various charging cables for cell phones etc. I have not tested this function yet. So far I rate this radio a 4 out of 5 stars due to the weather radio reception issue.

Sanus Systems LL11-B1 51 x 80-Inch Ultra-Thin Flat Panel Mount for TV,Electronics,3,1,2,N,Y,Low profile mount - but too low profile?,"I purchased this mount because I wanted to mount my Samsung 63\\"" [[ASIN:B003A7X5HU Samsung PN63C8000 63-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV, Black]] as close to the wall as possible, and this seemed to be the lowest mount available with the exception of the Samsung picture frame style mount, but that mount was over $200 and I had qualms about the stability of that mount (just mounts into the drywall - no thanks).<br /><br />I had read some of the negative reviews about this ultra low profile mount where users had a problem with having room for wires. On my Samsung, the inputs are oriented towards the side of the TV, so I figured I'd have plenty of room for wires.<br /><br />Installation wasn't too difficult, but the included instructions were pretty bad. I didn't find out until after installing that they have a video instruction on the Sanus website - I highly recommend viewing before installation. One thing to make sure you do before mounting the TV, is make sure you adjust the strings behind the TV so they hang down low enough (almost as low as the bottom of the TV) that you can reach them. You will need to pull these strings to make adjustments, plug in your inputs, or remove the mount later - so neglecting to adjust the strings prior to mounting, as I did on my first pass, can leave a major headache (I was able to fish them from behind the TV, and I removed the TV from the mount and adjusted the wires correctly and remounted ... again, had I watched the video I wouldn't have made this mistake in the first place).<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Well I have a couple of problems with this mount. The bracket that attaches to the TV grips the top of the wall mount, then is supposed to \\""click\\"" into place at the bottom in order to form a secure mount. Problem is, if there is anything back there at all blocking the TV, it won't click into place. This is the problem some of the negative reviewers who have TVs with inputs facing backwards have - it didn't leave any room for the HDMI or other input cables. In my case, my cables are perpendicular to the TV and don't seem to be the problem. What's even worse than the lack of clicking, is my TV isn't quite flat against the wall - the front of the TV is a little under 2\\"" from the wall on the left side, and a little over 2\\"" from the wall on the right side, for a difference of over half an inch. I think my culprit might be, the wall I have it mounted on is in a spot where an exterior concrete block wall meets an interior wall, with a sheet of drywall over the interior and the drywall has a very very slight (barely noticeable, and in fact not noticeable at all had I never tried to mount this to it) bulge to it. I think that very slight roundness is what is causing my problems with this mount. Yes, I realize this is mostly my own problem as I don't have a perfectly smooth mounting surface - but my point is, this \\""ultra slim\\"" mount by leaving only .55\\"" inches behind the TV leaves you almost no room for error. If there is any obstruction, including wires or anything else, you could have problems.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality of this product is pretty good. The one week spot I would point out, and I haven't tested it for failure, but the mechanism where you pull the strings to release the lock seems pretty flimsy. If this mechanism were to fail, you would potentially find it extremely difficult to remove the TV from the wall. And again, with the extremely low profile of the mount at only .55\\"", you'd have very few options to get back there and try to get the thing loose.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible product, but I have to recommend it with reservations. If, like most TVs, the inputs on your TV face backwards requiring some room for wires, I would look for a mount that isn't quite so close to the wall. Similarly, if your wall is anything but perfectly flat and smooth (get up with your eye next to your wall and look, the imperfection I'm talking about is not noticeableotherwise), this mount could give you problems. On top of that, the flimsy string mechanism would worry me a little bit as well. Finally, if your setup can accommodate an ultra low profile mount and you do decide to buy this product, make sure to watch the installation video on the Sanus website, and if installing into concrete, I'd go out and buy better anchors than what comes with this mount.<br /><br />3 Stars. Under perfect conditions it probably works fine and it does get the TV nice and close to the wall, but frankly I wish I'd just bought a less low profile mount to start with - it would end up looking just as good with much less hassle. I will probably replace this mount with one that has a little more forgiveness, likely one of the cheaper Amazon Basics models that get good reviews.oblems.

Flips Audio Collapsible HD Headphones and Stereo Speakers,Electronics,3,222,244,N,N,Honest review,"I received these headphone straight from Flips audio themselves, I took there try before you buy challenge. I used them over a couple of weeks to them an honest try. I used them as headphones and also used the unique feature and as the name suggests the ear cups flip out 180 degrees to act as powered amplified portable speakers.<br /><br />Here is the break down of the head phones.<br /><br />Presentation.<br /> The overall presentation of the headphones are very nice from the sleek packaging stating all the aspects of the headphones to the ample amounts of padding used to secure the headphones themselves. The headphones themselves are stored inside a semi hard shell. The. Hard shell itself Is more of an egg shape to accommodate the headphones in their folded positions. Inside the case comes the headphones in their folded position and a USB charging cable to charge the battery that is used when the headphones are used in the flipped out speaker position.<br /><br />Build quality<br /> The overall build quality of the headphones are a mixed bag. Some parts are built for use and abuse, like the sturdy metal hinges that are used when folding the phones to store them. While other parts seem just a little too weak for the job at hand. Ie. the pivot points of the actual ear cups have a very slight wobble when you flip out the ear cups to use as head phones. I do not know if they are designed that way or not. Also the headphones are a tight fit, after using them for an extended time the pressure of the head phone can be felt on the temples, even more so if you use glasses.<br /><br />Sound quality<br /><br /> The sound of the headphones are good but not great. The sound range of the headphones seem to be somewhat limited are a bit flat. Mind you all of the sounds are their and can be heard. But the overall mix of the speakers seems to limit what these speakers are actually capable of doing.On the up side they do sound much better when they are flipped out and usedas powered speakers.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />These headphones are descent headphones. But there are a few nuances That seems to keep these headphones from being great.

I wanted to make sure that there wouldn't be interference with our first monitor. The difference between the two monitors is overwhelming! This monitor does not make popping/crackling noises, or that odd bounding noise that my sounds and lights monitor does. In addition, the monitor really picks up the baby sounds well and makes them stand out over the background noise. We play a white noise machine (washing machine noise) and the noise cancelling feature does not eliminate this as background noise- however, it does minimize the sound in comparison to the babies noise in both modes. I cannot begin to say how wonderful the lack of static etc is, not to mention the choice of 27 channels! My only complaint is that using this monitor has made me supremely dissatisfied with my older monitor- so I may have to buy a second Sony!",10/26/2005,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
Sennheiser Closed Circumaural Hi-Fi Headphone,Electronics,3,4,5,N,Y,"Comparable sound, not comparable comfort to the HD555s","I just purchased these to replace my HD555s at work. Aaaand - I just printed the return label.<br /><br />I love my 555s, but the open design is not ideal for a shared workspace. There's substantial two-way leakage, meaning that, in order to block out my more obnoxious cube mates, I must jack up the volume... in turn contributing to the general obnoxiousness!<br /><br />On the other hand, the 555s are the most comfortable pair of cans I've ever put on, and I can wear them for an entire day with minimal fatigue. I've got some seriously sensitive ears, and even a bit of pressure or displacement becomes very uncomfortable quite quickly.<br /><br />Upon opening, I was immediately concerned with the slightly less space in the cups, and the leather-like padding material (in contrast to the 555's velour-y padding). FWIW, I was aware of the leatherette cups at purchase, and thought I could probably live with it, (hoping they'd not be too sweat-inducing). I had, however, purchased the 448s hoping that sticking with the brand would mean the same voluminous cups. Alas, it proved not to be so.<br /><br />Along with the above concerns, I wasn't impressed with the build quality by comparison. The whole kit was very plastic seeming and the cord was noticeably more flimsy than my triple-5 friends.<br /><br />I gave the 448s an hour. I immediately noticed the outside attenuation, which was a good start, but also noticed a bit more pressure and less room in the cans. Sound was good through the laptop -> E5. Maybe a bit less transparent, but that was expected, and asked for. I didn't experience major discomfort, but I was *aware* of them the entire time, and thinking about how long it would be until I was going to experience cumulative discomfort.<br /><br />Then the decisive moment - I put the 555s on to compare. Ahhhhhh. Little fluffy clouds.<br /><br />Take note, Herr/Fraulein Sennheiser - closed version of the 555/558/595 design will be in my shopping cart the moment I am aware of such a product.<br /><br />So, back go the 448s, sadly, and obnoxious co-workers will continue to be battled with reciprocal obnoxious volume-raising.

Marshall Hanwell 50th Anniversary Speaker (04090736),Electronics,5,4,6,N,Y,"Best ""portable"" speaker ever...","I had been looking for a good sounding &#34;portable&#34; speaker. I must have seen about 20 different options. I started looking in the $200 USD range, obviously not the Marshall, but the reviews (i.e CNET) of such portable speakers would always make comparison to other better sounding speakers, including the Hanwell.<br />I am quite picky about sound.( I currently have a KEF home theater with a Velodyne subwoofer. I have my own dj sound system with Gemini amplifiers, JBL standing speakers and Mackie sub, AT 50 MX headphones. You get the picture. I am a sound freak.) I am always trying to get a good sounding system for different purposes.<br />So what about my verdict? I used to play the Bose Sound Dock 10 and it sounded so good. Now we own the Bose Soundtouch 30. Bose is really capable of delivering good music devices. The Hanwell is something else.<br />I just got mine. It is not produced by the same Marshall guitar amplifier/speaker company in England but by Zound Industries in Stockholm for Marshall. This company also produces their Marshall headphones which have great reviews too. I am not sure what components they are using but they could be from SEAS, a Danish company nearby with excellent components. I will have to write Zound to confirm this.<br />The Marshall sound is really outstanding as a &#34;portable&#34; speaker, considering you can carry a 23 lb speaker. It is not a speaker you will take with you around town, but is &#34;portable&#34; around the house. I wanted it for an outside dinning terrace, and it's just perfect.<br />As it is a single enclosure it will not give you any type of sounstage, but the mids and highs are good. Nice voice and guitars, and the lows are terrific for the size. It carries 2 6&#34;; woofers, but it sounds like 10 inches subs.<br />I couldn't be happier with my selection.<br />I got myself a Logitech Bluetooth device and it works perfectly with my ipad and iphone.<br />This thing Rocks. It will be good for a small party(dancing included), if it's not set in an open area. I suggest to place it next to the wall and floor, tilted at 45°. This way you get a better bass response and still direct the highs toward the ear level.<br />I used an SPL (sound meter) and at 1 meter it was pushing a very decent 97 dB. That's party level and not good for continuous listening, but it's nice to have it handy for that song that you really love.<br />So, if you want to have the best available sound from a &#34;portable&#34; 100 watt speaker, look no further. The looks are great too. Need Bluetooth? 30 USD and you are set.<br />I loved it so much I have ordered another one to play it in stereo. Now I will have a &#34;portable&#34; party system. Who could ask for more?<br />This speakers are a commemorative item, so they will become collectibles. The original price was 1000 USD. Under $600 they are a steal. They sure sound like a thousand dollars. Thanks Marshall. Thanks Zound Industries. From a grateful sound freak.",1/6/2015,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Acoustic Research ARi3G 3 3 Device Universal Remote Control Compatible with Apple Products (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Great control concept with a couple flaws,"I'm giving this five stars purely on function, it is not the best tactile experience and lacts some programming features but fills a nitch that i could not find anywhere else. If you are no longer using a cable STB and watch a majority of video content on the web (I'm using it with a Mac mini htpc) and don't want a 40 button monster remote then this is a perfect fit, Of the three functions, one is your tv which becomes the standard channel up/down volume up/down input select and mute. The next two become your audio receiver or a/v receiver and the last becomes your media device (apple tv or htpc for example). Programming is pretty standard but I could not reprogram the menu button since it is used to exit the programming mode. Other than that the only other problem I have with it is the small throw of the buttons. I could not find the programming code map on the web so if you are wondering it includes a very large tv, av receiver and audio receiver list along with a list of media devices like apple. That is it - no DVD/blue ray for example. This product is all about simplification - it's very small (half the size of a standard universal remote), goes completely black (other than the ar label) when it's not moving (it has a tilt sensor to activate the button LEDs) and limits the buttons to an absolute minimum.",2/20/2011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

The bulb was the original and I was surprised how long it lasted. When the bulb finally gave out, I didn't want to invest a lot in this older TV even though it is just like new. I saw bulbs from 29.00 shipped all the way up to the original Philips unit as high as 150.00. Since there are options with the case and without the case, I read the reviews and decided to forgo the case as most people ended up taking the bulb out of the case and putting it in their original case to get it to fit back in the tv properly. There are two wires that are attached with nuts to the bulb, on on the rear of the bulb and one on the side. Be careful with the one on the side. It is not as secure as the original bulb. Hold it firmly so it can't move and tighten securely. The new bulb was noticibly brighter, possibly because mine was so old. It is like having a new tv, even the colors are brighter. I am happy for now. I am interested to see how long this bulb continues to work, but for the price and improved quality, I can't complain.

When I complained they said they don't have anything else that is an equal replacement. After multiple emails, including to their VP of Sales and Marketing, I was promised a new $199 pair.

"Elite Screens Spectrum Series, Electric Drop Down Projection Screen,",Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,A great screen at bargain price,"I have done a lot of research on screens after purchasing an Epson 5010 projector. That particular projector was a bit past my budget, so I had to cut corners on the screen. I was looking for the best bang for the buck while trying to achieve the best picture possible. I found that in the Elite 100&#34; electric screen. I have owned the screen for about 3 months, but it was only installed 2 months ago. I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing as I was concerned about a few things I had read in other reviews. First, I bought this screen at about half the price that it is now. Amazon had a great deal going right about the time I bought it. I was worried that a &#34;budget&#34; screen wouldn't do my Epson justice but that is not the case. The picture is fantastic. I had read about problems people were having with curling. The sides of the screen do curl a bit, but it does not affect the picture at all. The motor is SUPER quiet, and rolls up and down with an elegance that belies the price. I popped the batteries in, pushed the remote button, and my screen was rolling. I had called Elite for some suggestions on placement, and they were excellent in responding, and even though they do not install screens they offered advice on how to install my screen in a drop ceiling. I leave the screen down to avoid wear and tear on the motor, but it works just like it did from day one. The picture on this screen is better than I could have ever expected, and for a &#34;budget&#34; screen this is just an excellent way to save some money while enjoying your movies in a larger-than-life adventure. At the price I paid for this, this is just an excellent screen. Highly recommended.",7/14/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

I am still really impressed by the sound quality. The only thing that I don't like is the relatively thin padding and the small degree of adjustment available for the size of the head.

Sony HTCT100 Sound Bar with Subwoofer - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,4,4,N,N,A great solution for the price,"Pros - Only 2 pieces as opposed to 7 with a traditional 5.1 setup, which also means... - Only 2 wires! A power cord and a wire to connect the sub/receiver to the soundbar. - Decent sound. This is NOT going to sound better or even as-good-as a standard 5.1 system, don't fool yourself. - Price. My wife found these for $250, and that's a pretty darn good price. - Connections. The thing has a LOT of them. Cons - The remote. Seriously, the thing has about 40 buttons and I only use 5, volume up/down, mute, power and input. And crazy enough, even those aren't laid out very well. - Setup. People complain that there is no mid-range or that voice is hard to hear. These are people who obviously have either never set up a 5.1 sound system before or didn't read the manual. By default, the center channel is very quiet and the subwoofer is very loud. It took me about 15 minutes of going through the manual before I finally figured out how to alter those two settings, and now there's no issue with quiet speech or the lows drowning out the highs. - As I mentioned, this does not sound as good as a 5.1 system. Soundbars are for people who want decent sound at a reasonable price and don't want to monkey with receivers or wires snaking through their walls or under their carpet. In that regard, this product is a resounding success. I lament the fact that I don't get a true surround sound experience anymore, but I'm happy that my children no longer pull my speaker stands down on top of them, or futz with my receiver's buttons and throw everything off. It's easy (once you set it up) and it sounds great. You can't ask for much more than that.",10/15/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

K-TOR Pocket Socket Hand Crank Generator Portable Power Supply 10 Watts 120 Volts Made in the USA,Electronics,5,45,54,N,Y,A Handy End of the World Device,"Well folks, 2012 is finally here and some people tell us it's the end of the world again. Are you prepared if something natural or manmade knocks out the power system for an extended period of time?<br /><br />A solar eruption like the Carrington Event of 1859 would fry the planet's electrical grids. Try manufacturing millions of replacement transformers when the world has gone dark; it could literally take years to restore power. Then there's foreign enemies setting off EMP weaponry high in the atmosphere with the same devastating result. Of course, more mundane weather disasters could also knock out power.<br /><br />The K-TOR Pocket Socket along with a battery recharger and rechargeable batteries will give you some solace and keep your battery powered lanterns, CD player-radios, fans, and other devices working. I tested my K-Tor on recharging the batteries in my portable 9 inch DVD player. The good news is that I can relax in my bunker and keep watching my favorite programs on DVD after civilization has collapsed. The bad news is that it takes over 3 minutes of \\""light, easy cranking\\"" for every 1 minute of viewing. Or you can attach your K-TOR to the Lenmar DVDU923 battery pack; recharging it offers a lot more resistance and requires some muscle power, but delivers about 16 minutes of viewing for 5 minutes of cranking. [[ASIN:B0011MZORU Lenmar DVDU923 Universal Li-Ion Battery for Select Portable DVD Players]] A competitor, the ERDVDMAX battery pack provides 17 viewing minutes for 5 cranking minutes. [[ASIN:B00076QBHS Technuity ERDVDMAX Battery, Universal Nimh for Portable]]<br /><br />My initial effort at battery recharging suggests it could take an hour or more of cranking to recharge four AA battteries. Obviously, only an exercise freak would use this device so long as electricity is flowing out of wall sockets. But if/when there's no other source of electrical power, the K-TOR could be worth its weight in gold.",1/2/2012,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Tecsun PL880 Portable Digital PLL Dual Conversion AM/FM, Longwave & Shortwave Radio with SSB (Single Side Band) Reception",Electronics,3,162,171,N,Y,"Excellent AM and FM, not so good SSB, Sync, or weak signal DX.","There are many things to like about this radio. It appears to be of high quality construction, the tuning knobs have a good feel to them and operate smoothly, and it has a sound bigger than the relatively small size of the speaker would suggest. There are some problems with it, however, mainly related to SSB and weak signal reception. I would urge prospective buyers to research the radio in the Yahoo Groups for the PL-880. It was brought out in the group that there appear to be multiple firmware revisions available, and that batch 8820 is the most recent. Earlier versions had even more problems than the 8820, so do yourself a favor and check.<br /><br />The radio does have sync detection available by pressing and holding either one of the SSB keys. However, sync does not hold well at all, and it also adds considerable distortion. There are multiple filter options available, but SSB is limited to 4 KHz, even when sync detection is activated, which limits the fidelity of the radio. There are also other problems with the current firmware which cause the bandwidth to change when you try to tune a SSB signal, and also cause the audio to jump around when trying to listen to a weak signal. The front end overloads easily with an outdoor antenna, even when the signal is attenuated by using the 3 position switch to cut down the antenna gain.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a good looking radio with a great sound for AM and FM only, I would recommend it. If you will be listening to more Shortwave, Longwave, or SSB, and want a functional sync detector with a reasonable bandwidth for good fidelity, then I would hold off until the design matures more. Also beware firmware revisions 8819 and below at this time. These should be &#34;B&#34; stock and not sold as new.",12/20/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM / FM Portable Radio,Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,Excellent Portable Radio with Crank Charger,"Having purchased a smaller unit Eaton several years ago, I was prepared to be unimpressed. But this slightly larger unit has far superior tuning, reception and sound quality. I was disappointed to see that it doesn't come with a wall adapter, but later realized that it's not necessary because the crank is so incredibly effective. A brisk two-minute crank literally powered the radio for over five hours! It's so easy there really seems to me to be little reason to install batteries in storage and watch them slowly die.<br /><br />It should be noted that the manual indicates a limit on the total number of manual charges the internal battery can sustain, which means cranking may not be a suitable technique for routine operation! But as a standby communication device it seems just about perfect.<br /><br />I'm quite impressed with the value contained in this nice little package.",4/29/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I think the cable can support up to 1080p, but I don't have a 1080p TV, so I cannot confirm that. Audio quality works seamlessly as well. According to research I did on Google, there is no noticeable difference in quality between the $60 cables sold in stores and the $6 cables sold online, until you get to very long length cables. At 15', this cable is certainly long enough for me, and is WAY cheaper than the alternative, so I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",9/5/2011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,0,0,N,Y,Great Clock for the Price,"Needed a new alarm clock, nothing fancy, but had to be dependable with easy to read numbers, yet soft on the eyes. The Sony display numbers are 0.9” tall in a light green LED, which are very good. This Sony device fits the bill with a fairly small footprint (approx 6” wide, 6” deep and 3.25” high). In fact, for the money paid, it comes with a couple of features that, for me, are a bonus. First, it has Automatic Time Set, which is adjusted by your time zone, and should never have to be reset with the built-in lithium battery. With that is a daylight savings time adjustment feature that works automatically with the built-in calendar. This is not a huge deal, but a very nice convenience. But I did get this primarily for its alarm feature and it does not disappoint. There are two alarm settings (A and B) and I use A for weekdays and B for weekends. Nice and convenient. While it does have a snooze control that works, I do not particularly use that feature, but it is there if and when needed. The tuner is pretty good and will, more than likely, be affected by how well AM and FM signals are in your specific area. For me, I am able to capture my favorite few stations.

It just so happened I was in desperate need.<br /><br />I have not had cable for about 5 years now. It was just getting ridiculous. So, like many others, I bought an antenna to get local channels. I tried three or four antennas of various cost, and it was always chopping and crappy. I could never get a solid digital signal. I gave up on ever seeing my local channels again.<br /><br />This antenna, on the other hand, is totally different. It has a pretty good range on its own (despite being paper thin), but it also has a signal booster. It is powered by USB if you have a USB port on your TV (most TVs have this, and it says &#34;for service only,&#34; but it works great); if not, there is a little power adapter you can also attach. The cords are all nice and long.<br /><br />With this antenna, I am getting channels I didn't even know existed in the area. My local channels are clear as can be, no choppiness at all, and I get the public channels as well. I'm thrilled! I had given up on ever seeing them again, but now I have them, for free, with this antenna, which works where other antennas totally failed me.",4/15/2015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

When I saw the Grace Tuner and found out I could get internet radio stations, Pandora, and stream my MP3's from my NAS drive, with audio coming through my stereo, I had to try it out. I have the product installed using ethernet because I keep my router with my home theatre equipment (for PS3, XBOX 360, and Kaleidescape) so I cannot speak to the Wifi but every review I have read says the Wifi works great. From the moment I powered it up, it has worked flawlessly. I have located several local radio stations, setup my Pandora account to stream to the Tuner, and connected my Cisco NAS 200 box to stream my MP3 collection. I am using my iPhone as a remote, which is a great FREE feature for this device. The LCD screen, as many have said, is not that detailed, but it is clear and bright. My only gripe would be that when scanning through my 50GB of MP3's, I have to scroll through all the artists or albums to get to the one I want, so if I want to listen to Warren Zevon I have to scroll from the A's to the W's.

GE 24700 Flat Panel Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,1,1,2,N,N,Piece of junk,"Just bought a brand new panasonic passive 3d tv to replace an old sony in which we were still using a converter box. Don't have cable, never have, never will. Anyhow, decided to buy a new antenna. My husband picked up this model @ Home Depot and its junk.<br />When we first installed it, couldn't even pick up channel 49(ION) Had to rescan at least 6 times. Every time you change channels, you have to get up and fiddle with the antenna, I mean everytime! If you're on 26(FOX), flip to 49(ION), antenna won't even pick it up, screen goes black and tells me channel is unavilable. If you're on 49 and flip to a major channel like CBS/NBC/ABC, picture continuously pixilates, sound goes in and out, so jump up and fiddle with the antenna. What's the point of remote control if you have to keep jumping up to move the antenna? Sometimes I just give up and turn it off. I've tried putting it in the window, turning it upside down, horizontal,vertical, antenna all the way up,half way down, all the way down and I only live about 12.7 miles from most of the major towers with no tall obstacles in the way! A couple of them are around 17 miles away, but those aren't the stations I have trouble with.<br />We have a 4 yo HD Magnavox in the bedroom, using a 4 yo,$5 Dollar store loop antenna that gets better reception than this amplified, optimized HDTV GE antenna does.

I have a regular Sony Dream Machine and I wanted one that would work with my Ipod so that I could fall asleep to my relaxation apps and audio books. It works great. I thought it was very easy to set up and it took less than 5 minutes out of the box! The directions were clear and it was pretty intuitive. I love that you can dim or turn off the LED completely. The sound is just as good as my other Dream Machine and I would explain it as &#34;personal use&#34; speaker. I wouldn't use it any louder than 16... it's not a boom box it's an alarm clock radio and as such it's great! It met all my criteria: Ipod compatible, back-up battery, LED dimmer, Sleep timer, FM radio to wake-up to my favorite station, Antenna to ensure my favorite station comes in, and it is just the right size. For an Ipod it doesn't come with the seat part so you do need to have that piece that comes with your Ipod to fit in the clock and hold the Ipod in place. Mine was white and I think it looks cool to have the white piece on the black clock. It does come with three various seats for different versions of the IPhone.

"APC AV C Type 2-Outlet Wall Mount Power Filter, 120V",Electronics,5,2,2,N,Y,Well Built Power Filter,"Received the power filter before requested promise date and I used the free shipping option. :) The unit is very well built with a heavy duty power cord and plug - nice that the plug is a right-angle plug so it fits snuggly against the wall outlet. The unit came with its own mounting bracket - though I did not use the hardware included - wanted to be sure it never came loose from the wall so used screws that were a little more substantial. The mount bracket slots are spaced nicely and accepted the heavier screw, (my choice) also included is a template to mark the location of the screw holes and a sketch of the unit to show the dimensions of the filter prior to mounting as to not contact the TV mount. Having the LED lights on the end plate of the filter is a great location making them easy to read with a glace behind the TV. All in all - very satisfied with the packaging, construction and ease of mounting and would definitely purchase another one of these for a second/third TV an or home theater device in another room.",4/19/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monster 1000hd Ultra-High Speed Right Angle HDMI Cables,Electronics,3,2,4,N,Y,The wrong angle,"The cord itself is well built and delivers as a legit monster product. However...unless you have an old TV with one HDMi slot, this cord will block your other ports and forget about using it on the side HDMI, the angle of it makes it useless. You can put the right angle in the output of the digital device but you will then have to place your device on a book or something to lift it off the table to account for the length of the angle. This is with a 55 inch Vizio. On my 42 inch Sylvania LED, the HDMI ports are on the bottom of the TV so the right angle bumps into the front face plate and cannot be plugged in.<br /><br />It's a good idea to make sure the HDMI ports on the back of your TV are flush and not close together otherwise it will block the other ones. Also, the side HDMI is a no go as newer TV's are thinner than the inch and half angle length making it so you can't even plug it in. This will only work with a flush HDMI slot on the back of your TV. It was created to eliminate the wasted space from your cables jutting out like zombie arms. Good idea, but to be used for ideal situations as listed above.",10/31/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Was a bit worried with some of the negative ones, but since it was compatible with the the dish network figured I would give it a try. When it got here looked for the code for the dish and followed the directions which were easily understood. First code I entered was a hit and I could again changes the channels on the dish. Then tried to look up the code for my TV. Not so lucky there, they did not have it. Tried using the 0 code that was suppose to work if your TV was not listed, but that did not work. So then tried the learning command. Again no luck, tried a few times, but could not get it to work. Figured since I really had only gotten it to replace my dish remote was not a big deal. Even though it would have been nice to only have to use one remote. After reading the learn directions again realized I might have been doing it wrong. So today tried again to learn some of the TV remote commands. This time it was successful with one minor glitch. When I use the volume control it works backwards. When you turn it up it goes down and when you turn it down it goes up. Not a big deal since I can now control the dish and TV from the same remote. The off and on for the tv works fine. I did not program anything else yet because for now that is all I need, but it is nice to know that if I want to put more things on the new remote I can.",1/21/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I replaced the static, unpowered, splitters with one that were designed for HD signals and reran a new RG6 cable to the box that the other boxes could not see.

Apple iPod classic 160 GB (7th Generation) NEWEST MODEL,Electronics,2,6,9,N,Y,Apple goofed...or they want people to abandon the Classic platform.,"I'm really surprised. I wanted to like this but Apple was asleep at the wheel. Never thought I'd say that about them. I just started using it, so there are things I haven't experienced yet. I used to own a 5Gen iPod, 80 GB, which I loved. But it got stolen and this was a replacement. I'd now sacrifice the added capacity to get my old model back. FTR, I also own an iPad 2, another great Apple product. I have been considering buying a Macbook Pro and leaving the Windows universe. This product is so flawed I'm reconsidering...seriously. Here are my first impressions...I'll start with the positives. PROS 1. The face looks more elegant than my previous iPod and the unit is thinner (a constant aspiration of iterative Apple design). 2. Double the memory of my 5Gen, 80GB (though I still had room to spare on the 5Gen). That's it for the PROS. CONS 1. The HD makes noise when you use it. Other people comment on this, and it's true. My older iPod was silent. This one chirps/whirs every time I click the controls. It's not loud, but it gets really annoying. 2. MY BIGGEST GRIPE: The edges are SHARP! It's an Apple iPod for crying out loud. Apple is known for its elegant design and feel. What were they thinking? The seam between the metallic back and face is a sharp edge that goes all the way around the unit. And I've got big, tough man hands...Used tools all my life. This thing feels like a cheaply manufactured piece of Asian garbage. When I rub my fingernail against the edge, it planes off shavings...seriously! It really is sharp. If I don't return the unit I will run a file around it to soften the edges. Shouldn't have to. 3. The split screen may have seemed to a young, inexperienced designer like a cool idea to pack more info, but the truth is (as others have said here) it just mucks up what used to be a clean, usable interface. It is useful for things like Settings, where it give more detailed info, but for most of the use it just shows pieces of album covers -style over substance. The user should be able to modify its function in Settings. There has been a trend to add thumbnail pics to everything, including smartphone apps. Often, though this adds tiny visuals that add nothing but get in the way of great clean interfaces. There is a reason Craigslist still rocks with its seemingly stone age interface. IT WORKS! You get exactly what you need without superfluous visual muck that competes for your attention. I consider it a step backwards. I have not yet tested it thoroughly to hear if, as other have mentioned, the sound quality has been degraded over previous models. For me the CONS are significant. The Classic has been out for years now. Every change should be an improvement. I really wonder if they WANT people to run away from non-iPod \\""Touch\\"" models. If so, making people waste money on unpleasant designs like this is a pretty annoying way to do it. Good money for a device that feels like handling a steak knife by the blade. Recommend evaluating a unit physically before buying online to see if you like it.",12/7/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maxell 298022 60 Minute Digital Mini Video Camcorder Tape - 4 Pack,Electronics,5,2,2,N,Y,Maxell Mini DV Works well with HDV Too!,"I have been buying these tapes for years because of their higher reliability compared to cheaper mini DV cassettes, such as some JVCs that I tried before. I do a lot of HDV recording, but the price of Sony \\""HDV cassettes\\"" is way too high to be efficient. My archive library consists of over 300 mini DV tapes because they hold so little footage, and I trust these Maxells to store my HD footage. They record for about 01:02:30, that being about 2.5 extra minutes you get out of them which I have used on occasion! They work well with my Sony HVR-M15AU mini DV/HDV deck and dropout rate is very low. I used these as a backup for a critical show production requiring pristine quality video where computers would otherwise fail. Because HDV is a digital format, the tape quality does NOT affect picture quality, but it DOES affect reliability (i.e dropouts and errors). If you need cheaper tape stock for HDV recording and playback, I highly recommend these as a cheaper alternative to the \\""HDV\\"" labeled cassettes.<br /><br />Say NO! to the HDSLR revolution!!!",10/5/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LG LHB977 1000-Watt Blu-ray Disc Home Theater In a Box (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,2,2,N,N,Everything that I wanted - and more!,"I bought this unit for my Family Room because I wanted to have the following there: 1) Better sound from the front speakers, 2) Bluray player, 3) Working surround sound (had problems with some FOX programs), 4) Netflix streaming. 5) Ability to use HDMI to connect everything<br /><br />I had an older THX certified Onkyo receiver and a Panasonic DVD player connected before - neither of them had HDMI support. I had surround sound, but it was using the small cube speakers from Cambridge.<br /><br />I am very happy with this unit. The front speakers have three drivers each and the sound is a lot fuller than my previous setup. The stands are kind of big, so you need to allocate floor space for them. I don't see any way to use the front speakers without the stands. You can use your own speaker wire for all speakers - something that is very important for me and not seen in some of the cheaper units. Since the subwoofer amplifier is in the main unit, you can move the subwoofer to anywhere you can get the speaker wire. My previous subwoofer had a built-in amplifier and I had to keep it behind the TV and use shorter line level cables to the receiver. This new subwoofer was actually vibrating the surroundings back there so I had to move it to another corner of the room with more open space. Was pretty easy since I had a large spool of speaker wire. I did not use any of the wire that was included with the system. I used a much heavier gauge with no problem.<br /><br />You should buy an analog sound meter to calibrate the speakers. There is a setup menu on the GUI that lets you send white noise to all the speakers. I had to knock down the center speaker a bit and crank up the two surrounds to get everything equalized. You can find a few on Amazon, like this one: [[ASIN:B0000YHNKG Extech 407706 Analog Sound Level Meter]] - but they are also available at RadioShack. Set it at 70db, C weighting, slow response. Send the test signal out the left front speaker. Adjust the volume until the meter reads 0dB. Then you just cycle through all the other speakers and adjust them so that the meter also reads 0dB. It's pretty simple and the meter is worth the money. You cannot do this with your ear. I have had my meter for years.<br /><br />The Bluray performance is great. The movies look sharp and crisp on my Sony SXRD projection TV in 1080p/60Hz. The Netflix streaming was also flawless. I didn't order anything from CinemaNow, but the interface seemed to work quickly - just like the entire GUI. Before this unit, I had never heard of Pandora Radio. It's very cool and super easy to use with this system. The unit must enable some Dolby matrix setting because Pandora radio comes out from the surrounds too. YouTube was also easy to use, but I think that prefer the Apple TV interface for this. I did not try Audio CDs or the USB port yet. Don't really need those with the Apple TV pulling all those stuff from my iMac automatically. The iPod dock seems pretty convenient, but again I don't need that since I have an Apple TV. I did try plugging in my iPod touch (first generation) into the dock and it couldn't seem to access it. I have some newer iPods that I can try - the manual shows a very complete GUI interface for the iPod integration so it should be a nice feature for those without an Apple TV. Now that I think about it- if I had bought this device first, I may have never purchased an Apple TV.<br /><br />The only thing that I am having trouble with is the integration with my Harmony One remote. It seems that LG does not supply discrete remote codes for source inputs. The 'InputNext' button downloaded to the Harmony was also not working. I had to re-learn that function and program it to the 'Enter' key for each Activity. The Harmony could not seem to switch between activities using this button, so I will just do it manually. I couldn't seem to find a way to have the LG skip over my unused inputs - like FM, AM, Coaxial, Optical. I am hoping for a firmware updatethat would do this because it would speed up the input switching task. I suppose they could also add these discrete codes using a firmware update. That would be great, but I'm not sure how long it would take Logitech to get the codes into their database.<br /><br />This system really is a great buy. I have not found another device close to this price that included HDMI inputs and full range front speakers. My room is about 15 x 20 and the sound levels are fine. I can recommend this device for small to large rooms without hesitation. I have a front projector in my basement paired with much larger in wall and a full 7.1 speaker system setup. This LG is a much easier setup that has great performance. Unless you are willing to buy and build a real home theater setup, you should be very happy with this unit.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-09: The iPod dock does work. Finally realized that I needed to use the iPod button on the original remote to access it. The InputNext button on my Harmony One would not cycle to the iPod. Also, the USB interface did play music and photos from a USB drive fine, but as was mentioned by others will not play videos.ed up the input switching task.

Sennheiser On-Ear 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle,Electronics,5,75,84,N,N,Exceeded my expectations,"I really rely on user reviews when buying unfamiliar technology, so when I was tempted to by a cheap IR wireless headset, I started reading reviews. I quickly decided to go with RF instead of IR because I wanted to walk all over the house, outside, etc.<br /><br />But there were tons of choices. The reviews kept taking me back to the Sennheiser RS-120, so I bought one. They are great!<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is great. I can walk anywhere in the house or in my backyard or front yard, and there's no problem with reception.<br /><br />What I really love is the way they stay charged. The headphones are equiped with rechargeable batteries, and when you drop the headset back in it's cradle, it charges automatically. Two hidden metal contact points in the headband automatically make contact with the metal points on the charger, so you don't have to plug them in. They are always ready.<br /><br />Now my wife wants her own set.",8/12/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yamaha Natural Sound Custom Easy-to-install In-Wall Flush Mount 2-Way 150 watts Speaker Set (Pair of 2),Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,Great speaker for the price!,"We recently converted from a rear projection TV to a wall mount plasma and we bought these speakers to replace our floor standing units. While I did not expect these speakers to do as well as my high end towers, I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. While they don't sound as good as my old Image speakers, they are a close second and are a fraction of the cost. The sound quality is improved by adding fiberglass insulation behind the speaker, but you may have to drive them a bit harder to get the same volume. I also had some issues with the clips not spinning out, but realized this was because I test fit the speakers a couple of times (first to test the fit, secondly to add insulation). I found that the problem is that the plastic clips get lose when you run the screw through them a couple of times. A bit of Locktite (nail polish would also work) will hold the clip to the screw allowing it to spin into position.",2/13/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Logitech mm22 Portable Speakers for iPod,Electronics,5,5,5,N,N,Perfect item for me,"I did a bunch of research on ipod speakers and found some that were pretty loud.

But this Logitch mm22 is perfect for me. I was actually impressed by the sound. Like I said it is for the beach and sits on the blanket with us. Someone wrote that the cradle kept falling. Well don't use it! Just lay the Ipod next to it. You don't even have to fold the speakers up. Just leave them down. If you buy ipod speakers for looks or major entertaining, you're a fool.

Kng 028623 Mcqueen Alarm Clock Radio,Electronics,1,0,0,N,N,"Cute clock, but *terrible* usability","My mother-in-law bought this for my 5-year-old son for Christmas. It's a nice looking clock and sounds decent. However, it is virtually unusable. It has, I think, 7 cones on it for control buttons. However, you have to use exactly two of them to set the time, the alarm time, the alarm on/off and the date. I'm an engineer and it takes me time to figure out how to do it. There's no way my 5-year-old can. And for him, he'll just hit the cones and change something and then you have to reset everything. Also, with the radio, it's not AM, only FM, despite the description. And there are no presets or even an indicator of what channel you're on. All you have is a Scan button. Hope you don't miss the channel you were looking for. This is just a very poorly designed clock. It looks nice, but I can't imagine they let anyone try to use it before they put it in mass production.",1/4/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phiaton PS 20 NC Active Noise Cancelling Earphones,Electronics,3,2,2,N,Y,Decent sound but negligible noise reduction,"The audio quality of the Phiaton PS 20 NC is above average: full bass, clear midrange and slightly rolled-off treble. The overall sound is \\""warm\\"". Using an equalizer to boost treble can restore some of the high frequencies. The large audio drivers may be uncomfortable for people with smaller ears.<br /><br />I used a set of Comply foam tips to improve ear comfort for longer listening sessions. The Phiaton's active noise reduction does not function effectively. Jet and wind noise are very audible with or without the noise reduction engaged. Compared to the Audio Technica ATH-ANC23 earphones I had previously, the Phiaton PS 20 NC provide negligible ambient noise reduction on a jet airliner (McDonnell-Douglas DC9-50). I tried back-to-back comparisons in-flight with a set of Ultimate Ears UE700 passive earphones with Comply foam tips, and the UE700 earphones allowed significantly less noise leakage than the Phiatons. In a relatively quiet office environment, the Phiaton's provide a subtle reduction in background noise, but it is not worth paying a premium for this minor improvement.",11/28/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sony NW-E107 Network Walkman 1 GB Digital Music Player,Electronics,4,30,39,N,N,"Very good sound quality, less than an oz, long battery","This new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins, esp. in the waist!) MP3/ATRACT players from Sony are the latest models of their Psyc line of digital music players. The new-age styling of these MP3 players does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.<br /><br />The new silver Psyc MP3 player features 1GB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick -- esp. in the middle area where the single AAA battery resides. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)<br /><br />What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase \\""up to\\"" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)<br /><br />Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.<br /><br />The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version). It has a nice, sharp backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit \\""muffled\\"" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).<br /><br />Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.<br /><br />In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little with transfering music. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions.<br /><br />Recommended.n trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet. <br /> <br />The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version).

The screen isn't overly large but the image is crystal clear. Sure, they both love the ipod touches and admittedly, this lil gadget is only for music/book listening and video watching-not playing games or communicating electronically--but for the price and given their primary desire was to listen to music and watch some videos, this was a perfect choice and is still compact enough to easily carry around or even run with.

I recently purchased a second one for a backup. I use it when sleeping at night to mask unwanted noises. The speakers are not too large for my ears - they fit fine as long as I use a soft pillow. I can imagine that using a harder pillow might be troublesome. The quality of the speakers are as I would expect and are very acceptable. The cord provided is not quite long enough for me to place my smart phone (which I use as the noise source) on my nightstand so I am using an extension cord. The only problem with the second purchase is that the headband seems smaller than the original and is very tight on my head. It seems that the product is now being promoted as a sports headband and not for use while sleeping so maybe a tighter fitting headband is more appropriate? Maybe it will stretch after some use, but it's definitely smaller than the original band I purchased.

Sony NWZ-W273 4GB Waterproof Walkman Sports MP3 Player,Electronics,3,2,3,N,Y,Love Hate Relationship,"Honest Review: This product is not perfect, but I couldn't swim without it. I was on swim team all throughout middle school and high school but stopped after graduation. I loved swimming but the process of getting in and out of the pool was a pain and you can't even listen to music. I recently started lap swimming again as my primary exercise. I heard about these waterproof headphones from a friend and I was pumped to try them. I read the reviews, I knew what I was getting into with all the complaints. My main issue is that water still gets in through the sealed ear buds even though I sized them correctly. I usually lose sound in one ear after 15 minutes of swimming. When they dry the sound does goes back to normal in both ear buds. I cannot do flip turns or backstroke without them falling out. I use them for my warm up, cool down and light-moderate freestyle. They do have a more cons than pros but I am so happy that I can listen to music while swimming that I will take it.",4/6/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Black),Electronics,2,7,9,N,Y,Unacceptable battery life,"This is a sleek-looking, overpriced and poorly engineered MP3 player. I bought it because I really liked my Sansa e200, but wanted more than the 4G of storage I had (2G of built-in memory, plus a 2G micro SD expansion card). I should have gotten an 8G e200 instead of the \\""View 16\\"". The worst disappointment about this device is the short battery life. The manufacturer's claim of 32 hours of continuous music play time is sheer fantasy. I have never been able to get it to play more than 5-6 hours of MP3 without needing a charge. Moreover, charging is very slow. I had it plugged into the USB port of my PC at work for about 4 hours this morning (it had been nearly dead at the end of the day yesterday). I got maybe 2-3 hours of play, then it shut down and gave me a red battery icon when I tried to start it. The controls are also considerably inferior to the Sansa e200. The e200 has buttons around the blue volume dial that do what you would expect them to do--like traverse a menu vertically or horizontally. The View has a weird rubber-like washer that you're supposed to turn in order to navigate the menu or change the volume. It gives no tactile feedback whatever. I had to draw a mark on the rubber \\""washer\\"" to determine whether it was actually turning or not (yes, it does turn, but the effects appear to be completely random). There are other bugs as well. For example, the display will often lag behind considerably; it will indicate that it is playing a song other than the one it is really playing...then suddenly it will update. I'm giving it two stars because it DOES play MP3s. For a short time. ------------------------ Update, 4 Sept 08 I still have this player, and am using it regularly at work to drown out the noise. (Yeah, and the voices...) Obviously, I'm not so dissatisfied that I returned this player. However, I still wish I'd bought the tried and true Sansa e-series instead. The mechanical design of the View is actually pretty good--thoughI still hate the rubber washer that you're supposed to turn to choose menu options. The problem was and remains the firmware. I've updated to the latest version (the one released in June 08), and I think play time has improved by about 25%. It's still far short of the promised 35 hours, but it will do for my purposes. However, the player continues to emit novel mutant behaviors. For example, the songs seem to multiply like bunnies. I'll select an artist or an album, and there will be about 8 to 10 entries for each of the songs that should be in the list. I'm sure the content hasn't actually been duplicated--I had about 20G of MP3s on there to begin with (have the 16G model with an 8G Micro SD card)--I think it's a database corruption issue. There's just numerous pointers to the same song. I have no idea how this happened--I've just been playing the music, and haven't downloaded new content via my PC. This is a major hassle, as I have to manually fast forward to the next song by skipping over the spurious entries. Putting the Sansa on random play means hearing the same songs over and over again, as it keeps finding the duplicate entries. Bah.",5/2/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I finally bought my first digital TV (great deal on the LG 32LK330 here at Amazon) and wanted to change that.

(TVGuide says there are 56 digital channels in my area but I don't think I'm going to bother with an extension to try to get the other 4.)<br /><br />The Mohu Leaf is giving me 5 times as many channels and will pay for itself it 6 weeks.

Supersonic SC252 Personal MP3/CD Player,Electronics,1,0,1,N,Y,"Junky, worked briefly and died","I suspect the manufacturer knows he is making a piece of junk but the very low price will entice buyers. I have many MP3 CDs, mostly books but also music. You can get 10 hours on one CD. But that system is dying and the good manufacturers have stopped producing MP3 CD players. My Supersonic never worked with an a/c adapter, and you had to bang it and repeatedly press the buttons to get it working. After I played a few disks it just died and nothing could get it to work. Luckily more good old MP# CD players have recently appeared on the market and I ordered a Panasonic. If you need one stick to Sony or Panasonic. Also, can anyone explain to me why a seller is selling a new 12-year-old Panasonic at an insane price? I mean who is dumb enough to buy it when good used ones are selling 10 times cheaper.",3/8/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iSkin eVo3 Upgraded Protective Case for iPod with Video 30GB and 60GB w/ Belt Clip (60GB, Eclipse)",Electronics,5,2,3,N,N,Excellent Product,"I don't really know what else to write here.

The iSkin I bought for my 80 GB iPod is of excellent quality and finish, and serves its purpose just as is claimed for it. In addition, I would also commend the company covercase.com which supplied it to me at Amazon's behest. The service was quick and packing good. I am surprised to see a reviewer's negative comments below concerning covercase.com, although the iSkin.com website was not as responsive concerning some queries regarding problems I had when fitting the plastic shield to the silicone case's guide lips.

"Cerwin Vega VE-5M 5-1/4"" 2-Way Bookshelf Speaker (Pair)",Electronics,5,46,47,N,N,Forget Using These as Surround Speakers...,"Instead, set them up as the main speakers in a 2-channel stereo setup. They rock! Simple as that. Yeah, \\""only\\"" 60 Hz., but damned if it ain't an honest 60 Hz.!<br /><br />These speakers are really excellent for their size. They will almost take pretty much all you can throw at them (their impedance is 8 ohms, and they'll handle up to 125W peak), and at slightly saner listening levels, they are sweet, solid, punchy, balanced, articulate, clear, and just plain fun to listen to!<br /><br />Get a pair, and try them for yourself. Jazz, Rock, Classical, these really deliver. Dub? Hip-Hop? They only go down to 60 Hz.! Toss in a sub, and you'll be doing pretty good! Otherwise, turn up the bass a little bit (they're only 5\\"" drivers), and let them take you away!<br /><br />Solid build, and solid sound. In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with these speakers. They are that good!<br /><br />Update:<br />As I've been listening to these speakers, I am realizing that I really don't need to turn up the bass in order to get a solid sound! Even at lower volume levels, levels where you might consider switching in the Loudness button, I find that when leaving the Loudness off, and leaving the tone controls set flat, the sound is still very full and balanced, and the bass is solid without being boomy or otherwise smearing the rest of the sound! And when turned up with the tone controls flat, the sound is balanced, solid, and punchy; the percussive nature of the music comes through naturally.<br /><br />Listening to Beethoven's 5th Symphony, the second movement, the quiet Double Bass notes are deep, rich, detailed, and solid. Listening to Steely Dan's song, \\""Babylon Sisters,\\"" the sound is percussive, deep, sparkly, and clean! Dave Brubeck's \\""Take 5\\"" is detailed, and natural. The bass sounds woody, deep, and very clean, and the drums are sharp and solid, with clean, and detailed cymbal sounds!<br /><br />I keep focusing on the bass, and the percussive nature of the sound because that's what usually gets compromised in a small speaker system. In my opinion these speakers are well designed, and well executed. They continue to amaze me!",2/23/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UP DATE . its 5/10/13. sub still works great. like i said i have paradigm subs. this will not go down as low or play as loud . but/ this only has a 100 whatt rms amp 50 watts contiouns. my paradigms have 300 and 200. thats a big difference. i also have def tech 8040s with built in 300 watt subs . in each speakers this is my main ht system . the polk is in our bed room with a yamaha rx-v 671 . and jamo speakers. alot of people dont take the tim to set up the speakers or sub . most just set it where they can plug it in and turn the knobs till they stop. not good. then say its muddy it clips it s not loud ect. all im saying is you have to spend a little time messing with it its a very decent sub for the price. theres subs out that cost more than this and sound terrable. i ran the yapo on the yamaha and set the speakers to larg to see . then changed them to small reran it and what a difference . it taks some time. no there not audiophile but for what they are and the price its a good buy. im pleased with it and would buy another one which im going to buy two more for my sons for there rooms . yes they have some port noise when pushed at higher volumes but the amp is 50 watts contiounus 100 is rms. i use it for ht and music and play it loud at times . it was designed for somuch and thats all. im pleased and would recamed this for someone on a budget or wants to keep cost down . i bought it on a whim it was cheap and looked decent . its polk . so there you have it . good luck .,5/7/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,
APC LE1200 Line-R 1200VA Automatic Voltage Regulator,Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Huge!,"I really have no way of testing the quality of this voltage regulator. All I know is that it's much bigger and heavier than I was expecting.

However, it was a very smooth sailing for my computer, over those years. I think the most important thing you can do is buy a quality motherboard and then protect it with a good voltage regulator such as this one. My feeling is that if you don't, you might get that one power surge when you weren't paying attention and it will weaken the board to where you'll have periodic blue-screen problems from then on out for years to come. I certainly don't trust the standard surge protectors which can be bought at the department store.<br /><br />I just did $600 worth of upgrades to my computer and I needed to protect my investment.",3/26/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sony MDR-XB500 40mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass Headphones,Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,Cant beat the price.,"PROS:<br />Comfy. Wearable for long periods of time (multiple hours). Sometimes I leave them on even when my musics stopped playing just because it's a serviceable noise reducer.<br />Deep, rich bass. Really fleshes out a lot of music.<br />Tangle-free cord.<br />Should something ever happen to my pair - the price isn't much to replace.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Might have to adjust EQ if you're trying to avoid too much bass, as it really amplifies it. Ive listened to dance/electronic, metal, and hip-hop, and it all sounds real good with these. I'm no audiophile though.<br />They look rather comically big when wearing them, but I only use them at my desk or at home anyways.<br />Ear pads get a little warm in warm weather.

DIRECTV RC71 Remote Control,Electronics,2,39,46,N,N,Design needs much improvement,"Let me preface this review by saying I have just started using this new remote (RC71) after years of using the \\""regular\\"" DirecTV remote (RC65 universal IR remote).<br /><br />First off, the back of the remote is a hard plastic with no sort of grippy texture or rubber coating so it is quite slippery, especially when you're using the top portion of the remote, which includes all the buttons except the number pad. I don't watch much live TV these days. I record everything and watch it later which means I rarely use the number pad and my hand is almost always towards the top of the remote using the playback functions (guide,list, menu, play, pause, record, etc). Also, because of the design of this remote and the fact that I use the top half almost exclusively, I always feel like I'm about the drop the remote because of how small it is and how it balances in my hand.<br /><br />Another thing that really irks me is there is no STOP button like the old remote had and like you'd expect to find on a remote control that is supposed to be used to play recorded shows and movies. I'll tell you how I used my old remote so you can see why this is a problem for me. lets say I'm watching a recorded show and I want to stop it because I want to finish it later or im in the mood to watch another recording. I should be able to press STOP but there isn't a STOP button. So now I have to either hit pause (so the show doesn't continue to advance) then either hit the EXIT button (which takes you out to live TV) or hit LIST button then find another show to watch and play it. I can just hit the EXIT button to take me out of the show but that brings me to live TV and not to the list with my recordings.<br /><br />Yet another thing that ticks me off is I can't delete a recording that I'm currently watching without going into the list. With the Old remote and old DVR, I was able to just hit the delete button and the currently playing recording would delete. Now I have to go to my list, go downto the recording I want to delete and press the delete button to get rid of it. Why all the extra steps?<br /><br />With all this said, I should mention that I just upgraded to the DirecTV Genie. Maybe some of these issues are related to how the Genie works and not the remote itself. Either way, this remote does not feel good in the hand.",8/14/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Blew me away. *WAY* better than iHome iHM9U,"I hesitated to buy this speaker, since I already had an external speaker for my mp3 player. But I was never really happy with the iHome iHM9U I had. It had been an impulse buy a couple years ago. When I plugged this Altec product in, I really wish I hadn't waited so long. No comparison between the sound. The iM227 is much louder, much clearer sound. Richer tones, and everything else about it just rocked. Rather than sounding muffled, it filled the room with decent sound. Yes, my home theater system is still nicer, but this Orbit speaker sounds more like it than like the dumb little pansy speaker I had before. And it's smaller, and easier to transport. What's not to love? I'm convinced this is the best product available for anywhere near this price.<br /><br />Just get it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />UPDATE: There's another (newer?) model of this product that includes 3 AAA batteries and an adapter that will connect the unit to devices with a 2.5mm plug (this model doesn't include batteries or the adapter). And, it's cheaper than this listing on Amazon (right now). I believe that other than those extra included items, it's an identical product.

I generally use this class of amps with IEMs while on the road but o I have compared this with the E3 and the newest Rocky and even with bass boosted I have a nearly silent background with the E6 and 16 Ohm IEMs. The Rocky, in comparison, has quite a bit of noise that persists with 32ohm Grados with amplification and bass on. This may be a function of having bass boost, amplification, and a microphone circuit crammed in there. But, there you go. If you don't need the mic and you don't have any particular preference for the controls (the E3 is significantly harder to manage in your pocket or such) the E3 seems to be the better package for pure listening.

Creative MuVo TX FM 256 MB MP3 Player,Electronics,5,26,26,N,Y,One of the best MP3 players out there. Gym Savvy!,"This is one AWESOME MP3 player. It has so many features and the fact thats they are also easy to use makes it even better. I may have had it for a few hours, but that's all I (and most people) need to operate this player to it full extent. I have made a pros and cons list as well. <br /> <br />PROS: <br />MENU SYSTEM - This is GREAT! It's so easy to use because of the icons and the scoller button. One of those players that you could operate out of the box without the manual. <br /> <br />SIZE - It's VERY small for an MP3 player. I can't say it's an amazing size because I came from an Panason SV-SD80 (THAT player, by the way, is INCREDIBLY TINY! The size of a psotage stamp). But the size DEFINITELY pocketable. <br /> <br />SCREEN - It has a nice blue backlit screen. Some people says it's too small, but I don't think so. It displays the battery life, time elapsed, type of EQ (equalizer), and song name (NOT artist). The only showing the song name is a little bad, but it doesn't seem to bother me much. Technically, you DO get the see the artist's name because right before you select the song, it displays the file name. If you put the artist's name in the file name, you get the see it for a split second. <br /> <br />Accessories - It comes with Creative earbuds, a belt clip, and an armbamd. The earbuds are nice sounding, but they are so big and thick in my ears that it hurts them after 5 minutes. The belt clip is rubber, which does WONDERS to the plastic surface of the MuVo. It grips the player. Plus, the way the belt slip is designed, you must stick in the key ring side of the player, so the MuVo's keyring goes into the keyring hole. That way, the player cannot fall out. That was hard to explain; it's something that you must buy the player or see the belt clip in order to understand. The armbad is actually nice to use. Not hard to use and the player is VERY safe. To use the armband, you have to use it with the belt clip, even safer. <br /> <br />SOUND - The sound was GREAT when I first used it. Then it got even better when I setup my settings for the custom EQ. NOW it sounds AMAZING. Plus, now I can actually hear nice music coming from Sony Street style headphones (I couldn't before on my Panasonic) <br /> <br />TRANSFER - SOOOOOO FAST! The USB 2.0 is amanzing when it's on an MP3 player AND a thumb drive. I LOVE the drag and dropp ability of the Muvo. My panasonin had to use Realplayer to transfer the songs. ABSOLUTELY ANNOYING! Now I have no fustration. Drag and drop and I outta the house. <br /> <br />FM RADIO AND VOICE RECODER- GREAT I just autoscan for the radio station. I don't know how many presets it can save total, but when I autoscaned, I got 16. still impressive. I don't have picky ears, so the FM radio recorder was nice to have and listen to. Voice recoder is nice but not high quality. Can't expect much from an MP3 player. <br /> <br />PRICE - I think it is a plus because you get all these things all together in one packeage: MP3 player, Voice recoder, FM radio/recorder, and flash drive. Plus, the original 256 MB MuVo TX that had NO FM radio was more expensive than this one. Funny, huh? <br /> <br />CONS: <br />NOT RECHARGEABLE OUT OF THE BOX - It didn't come with rechargeble batteries. It was kind of sucky, but I cant juss buy either ALOT of AAA batties, or a rechargeble battery kit. <br /> <br />NO LANYARD - It didn't come with a neck strap. I kind of like those because if you don't want to use the belt clip or armband, but still hands free, a neck strap would be nice. <br /> <br />NO DISPLAY OF ARTIST'S NAME <br /> <br />SIZE - I had said that size was a PRO of the player, but it's also a CON. When you separate the player and the battery pack to plug in the player, you'll notice that the player will take up the space of 2 PORTS. Kind of annoying for some people since for me, I don't have that many USB peripherals. I'm just telling those people who DO have all USB ports filled and a USB HUB. Other than that,size is still a PRO <br /> <br />Memory - Although 256 MB is actually ALOT more than I expected, it would be nice to have a 512MB version or even a 1GB version of this AWESOME player. 256 MB is definitely plenty for the average user and even above the average user. <br /> <br />All and all, VERY nice player. When I rate this player, I have no doubt in my mind taht is deserves a 5.",7/24/2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AKG Q701 Quincy Jones Signature Reference-Class Premium Headphones,Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Fantastic headphones! Put your bass fears to bed.,"If you're looking at these headphones, you must already know about head-fi. A good consumer would have read their reviews, and if you're like me, been terrified of the anemic low-end.<br /><br />There is NO NEED TO FRET.<br /><br />My primary pair of headphones before I picked these up were the Sony MDR-XB500 (XB for Xtra bass, bro). Transitioning between them does not make me feel a lack of bass. It is absolutely less dramatic bass response, but I don't feel like I'm missing anything. Bass tracks I fell in love with on my Sony's (Dead Man's Tetris by Flying Lotus is currently playing) sounds great and full, with clarity and articulation that doesn't need the &#34;Xtra Bass&#34; bloat.<br /><br />AND THE SOUNDSTAGE! Good lord, these feel so enormous! The way things move feels effortless, and the sound envelops you like a blanket fresh from<br />The dryer.(that is NOT saying it's a warm can; imagery only)<br /><br />These headphones are clear too! The texture of woodwinds comes across so exquisitely, i can feel the texture of the reed on my lips.<br /><br />I had concerns about the treble reproduction on these headphones, and I will say the treble (the hanging ring of bells for example) can be a tad aggressive, but by no means a deal breaker. That agressiveness has been defining in certain tracks, showing me more of what I was there to see.<br /><br />Lastly, I was concerned about the need of a headphone amp with these cans. While i'll still be buying an amp (little dot 1+) everything you've read has been experienced through my iPhone. I'm very excited to see how these will sound with an amp, but It's great knowing they're not lifeless without one!<br /><br />As My first pair of audiophile quality headphones, I feel these are a great selection, but I was almost scared out of buying them after reading reviews on head-fi. I'm glad I went with my gut.",2/18/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Onkyo TX-SR605 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver,Electronics,4,1,1,N,N,XBox Passthrough?,"Too early to give a full review of the SR605, although I can say that set up has been very easy and so far DVD sound is quite good. I like the automatic sound adjustment on first use. My complaint, or question for anyone that might have ideas on how to resolve, is that it does not seem to work as passthrough for Xbox 360 using component output. I hooked Xbox component output into SR605, HDMI output from SR605 to Aquos LCD TV. No video image. I wonder if this is due to XBOX outputting in 1080p, and SR605 converter having difficulty passing 1080p from component input to HDMI output. Onkyo support site has no answer to this. To resolve, I hooked Xbox component output directly to TV, but this means I have to switch TV input every time. One of the big advantages of SR605 is that you use it as the input/output switch, theoretically not having to switch TV input to change sources. Now for my, uh, kids (cough, cough) to play Xbox, we have to switch both SR605 and TV inputs. Any solution to this, or is this just a SR605 flaw?",10/13/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monster Cable TGHZ-2RF Two Gigahertz Low-Loss RF Splitters For TV and Satellite 2-Way 2 Gigahertz RF Splitter (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,13,13,N,N,One of few Monster products that's worth the price.,"While I'm no big fan of typically over-priced and over-hyped Monster products, I'll readily concede that this beats any of the 9 or 10 other splitters I tried. I see comments here from users who say they can't see a difference with this product; my comment to them is that they need a better tv. I also noted one reviewer who somehow heard that this splitter can't be used with CATV (It can, and I've been using mine for over a year with my digital cable hookup). Advantages: less noise and grain than others I've used, and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable company's \\""free\\"" piece of junk. Most notably, this splitter maintains excellent image contrast and has no visible chroma effects that I can see. Few splitters can manage all this. The only product I've tried that might beat this is a $[...] job whose brand I don't remember (probably because I ain't spending $[...] on a splitter, for any reason). Even if you're not crazy about Monster in general, you'll get your money's worth here. I'm using two in my setup with a CELabs booster amp.",10/30/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somehow, it is still great fun to use!<br /><br />Band scanning has been a weak point of digital radios... the sound is usually muted while slewing through the frequency range, leaving just a tuning indicator light to show that a station has been found (most will not stop scanning on weak signals), or if not muted, a loud \\""chuffing\\"" noise is produced as the frequencies are scanned. With this set you just turn the knob and listen for stations!<br /><br />If you want to easily find, say the BBC on 5.975 Mhz a digital radio will get you there much faster, but for scanning the band to see what is on, the old dial and pointer still works quite well!<br /><br />For a similar but smaller and slightly less expensive radio, see my review of the Kaito WRX911.

thinksound rain 9mm In-Ear Wooden Headphone with Enhanced Bass and Passive Noise Isolation,Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,Perfect for tiny ears!,"Six years ago when I got my first iPod I discovered that the standard ear buds would not fit my ears. It wasn't that they were uncomfortable; they would NOT physically even fit in my tiny ears. If I tried to put them in they would actively \\""pop\\"" (not just fall) out. At the time I ordered a second set of ear buds from Apple -- these had three sets of padding in various sizes. I thought surely the smallest size would work, but they did not. I then searched for reviews of ear buds that would accommodate tiny ears, but to no avail. I tried ordering a few other brands, but never had any luck. I settled for some large, noise-cancelling headphones and just gave up my quest for a smaller solution. I had concluded that my ears are just absurdly small and I was out of luck. However, I recently renewed my search and found a couple of helpful lists of the \\""best\\"" ear buds for small ears (notably an excellent one from CNET: [...]). I ordered two pairs: this brand and a JVC Marshmallow set that were both reviewed in the CNET article. While I was prepared to be happy with the cheaper JVC set, I was glad I ordered both sets as these Thinksound Rain headphones had a much wider range of small tip sizes. The JVC set, which had several positive reviews about being suitable for small ears, were not nearly small enough for me. However, I could actually use the second smallest Thinksound Rain earpiece set! It's a miracle! If you are looking for ear buds with a range of options for truly tiny ears, these are terrific.",6/22/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEElectronics Sports Sound-Isolating In Ear Headphones with Microphone/Remote for iPod,Electronics,3,0,0,N,Y,They are OK,"Pros:<br />1. Good for long distance running as they sit in your ear and need adjustments only a few times during the run.<br />2. The memory wire is very helpful and holds the earpiece in place with minimal irritation or creating any pressure on your ears<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The \\""with Microphone/Remote\\"" may lead customers o believe that it has remote volume control, which it does not. That is why I give it 3 stars. The seller should come clean and make it clear in the technical summary on the top that it does NOT have remote volume control.<br />2. The headset inserted for a good fit gives you good sound and bass but if you are running it also creates a thumping feeling with every step you take. That will negate the advantage of \\""quiet listening\\"" and will make any runner to loosen the inserts a little bit.

But after today I realized that I need to find a new brand or model. I have had similar issues with all three, but the first lasted much longer, and the one I have now is already crapping out on me after a few months. One consistent issue is the headphone jack somehow becomes damaged and will only play music on either just the left side or just the right side of the headphone. If I fiddle with it it will play in both ears for a few minutes, but the time and attention it takes to have the music play in both ears continuously is not worth it. The player also freezes and other times will not turn on unless you press down the On button for several seconds.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that will last a couple of years, this MP3 player is not it.",3/26/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nyrius Media Fusion TV Dock for iPod/iPhone,Electronics,2,0,0,Y,N,"Didn't do much for me, figuratively or literally","I can see the point of a tool like this, and I suppose if I didn't have access to my [[ASIN:B003L1ZYYM AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters)]] and a couple of adapters for my various Apple devices, I'd have tried harder to make it work. But since I do, the problems and disappointing performance of this Media Fusion TV Dock means it went right back in the box.<br /><br />I have an HD TV and, while not huge in relative terms, it was big enough to make the poor-quality graphics of the Nyrius display painful to look at. I would comment on the quality of the video reproduction, but none of the four video podcasts I tried to play showed up on screen -- audio yes, video no, and although I have 10 movies stored on my iPhone at the moment, this dock couldn't locate any of them (I question whether this dock is fully compatible with iOS 5). I could have tried showing photos on screen, but to get to the photo display, you have to manipulate the iPhone yourself via the touchscreen, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a remote.<br /><br />Music playback was fine. It would have been nice if the Nyrius showed album art on screen, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I know using a cable is still a step or two below wireless playback with AirPlay and/or an Apple TV. But until I get there, I will stick with my HDMI cable. It works a lot better for me than this product did.",10/30/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outdoor Tech Big Turtle Shell - Rugged Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Boombox & Powerbank,Electronics,1,4,10,N,N,My experience hasn't been positive.,"Based on the number of positive reviews, my experience may be somewhat of an outlier. I purchased the BTS via the Kickstarter campaign and received the unit in July. The unit arrived undamaged and partially charged. After getting it paired with my iPhone, I played some music off Pandora and noticed that the sound was distorted. Additionally, when the battery went low the speaker's voice began giving me the &#34;charge me&#34; indication. I plugged the unit in and, after being plugged in for quite some time, the &#34;charge me&#34; indication continued. Eventually, the battery died, while plugged in. I contacted Outdoor Tech and they sent me another charging cable/transformer. The new cable cured the charging problem. However, the biggest problem was the issue of the terribly distorted audio quality. The distortion manifests itself in a high(er) frequency buzzing/rattling sound as music is being played. I'm assuming that the speaker driver is either loose or defective or there is an issue with the enclosure. I appreciate high quality sound and happen to notice poor audio quality quite easily, my wife does not and yet she commented on the poor audio quality. I contacted Outdoor Tech again and they sent me a return authorization form. Due to my frustration with the unit (and the serious let down after FINALLY receiving the unit) I put it in a drawer and never sent it back. I just sent an email to Outdoor Tech to see if they will still rectify the situation and will update this review once I see how they will handle it. It is somewhat frustrating when a mail/web order item is defective considering the pain and inconvenience it is to deal with the RMA system and then, again, WAIT for a unit that hopefully does what it is advertised to do.",10/12/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, we've used it without fail. The Walkman has bounced off the front seat numerous times as the two of us are listening to e-Books, and never skipped a syllable! We're able to resume from where we left off by virtue of the fact we just don't remove the CD until we're ready to start listening again. I'm guessing there's a flash-mem which retains the current track position. Nonetheless, the Walkman is built sturdy and works well.

After listening to them, I would pay $100 if that was the going price.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Fits perfectly out of the box (six pairs of ear pieces to ensure find one that you can get a tight seal with)<br />- Very good highs, mids, and lows -- if you can't hear/feel the bass, then try a different ear piece to get that seal<br />- Amazingly comfortable even though this is deep in my ear canal<br />- Does not move at all during running; I can turn my head, do jumping jacks, etc... they stay in place<br />- Isolates from other noises -- no active noise cancelling but it will block noise, including your own voice when you speak<br />- Cord management is well thought-out; not only does it have a clip but it also has tightener where the left/right wires come together<br /><br />CONS<br />- Since a tight seal is necessary, I can hear the sound of the cords rubbing against my body when I'm running; in order to minimize that, I need to hang the cord in the front and not the back<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I really wish I bought these sooner. I'm glad I found a set of earbuds that are no longer 'just good enough' but actually motivates me to put them on and go for a run! The best $20 I've ever spent.",8/22/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sound is better than my old Sony headset, which is nice, although I had no issues with the Sony. It does require a separate receiver, which isn't cheap. That was an unpleasant shock.

URC R50 Digital Universal Remote Control for up to 18 Components (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,0,0,N,Y,Mostly Does the Job,"I purchased this device to replace three remotes and most importantly the remote provided for the DVR by my cable provider. The remote for the DVR also controls the TV and thus is the primary remote. However, its keys are difficult to push and my thumb was starting to get sore with use. I chose this remote because reviewers indicated it was reliable, sturdy and flexible. I agree that this remote is sturdy. You drop it and it keeps on working. The keys are easy to push with my thumb or fingers and minimal resistance. The side keys are a little small and not as convenient as the larger keys that control most of the functions. The side keys control up/dn for volume and channels, and certain functions of playback. They are OK once you adapt to the remote. The instructions are minimal in the print form but they are provided as a type of help function when you program the remote. It took me about 30 minutes to read the instructions and learn the basic programming method. My wife would never have figured it out. You need some technological sense to program it. Once you figure it out, then it becomes fairly easy to do. I was able to program it easily for my DVR (cable) and TV. The DVR box was Magnavox and the TV Panasonic. My DVD player is Panasonic would not accept a code number so I had to program it button by button. That is not fun and it is not as flexible. I programmed it to turn on the DVD but then I use the controls of the DVD to play, etc, as the button by button controls are not as flexible or intuitive. If all the devices had been programmed by using a code number I would have given it a 5 star. Even though I was not able to program the DVD I give it a 4 star because it is reliable and controls properly the DVR and TV, which I mostly used. If someone is challenged by technology I would not recommend it unless you have someone in the house who could set it up for you or trouble shoot it.",9/25/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smart&Safe® Hollow Air Tube Hands-free Headset - Reduces 98% of Harmful Radiation Emissions Generated By Cellphones - Compatible with iPhone & Blackberry and all Cellphones with 3.5mm Jack,Electronics,2,1,2,N,Y,Really great product...very briefly.,"I think the relatively high price for these requires the product be a premium product. Unfortunately it is not. Although the sound quality is great (really), and the tubes are the longest I've seen (best EMF exposure reduction from user), and the comfort is fantastic (triple-flanged rubber ear-inserts)...the sad part is that it malfunctioned only a few weeks after pruchase, and I hardly used it all (maybe 50 times). Currently I can hear the other person, but they can't hear me. Probably a break in one of the wires somewhere. Also: one of the triple-flanged ear inserts split and now doesn't attach anymore. I can't figure out how to contact the seller as Amazon says it's no longer eligible for a return.<br /><br />P.S. I also bought the \\""Natural Health Alternatives Black Hollow Air Tube Anti-Radiation Headset Stereo Model Emf Protector\\"" at the exact same time as a backup (thankfully) and it works well. It also has good sound-quality (almost as good as Smart&Safe), but is only half as comfortable, and the tubes aren't as long (less EMF reduction to user). Oddly, it's unfortunately REALLY loud, such that phone calls actually hurt my ears, even with the phone volume turned ALL the way down. I don't remember having this excessive volume problem with the Smart&Safe. I recall that the volume was just right.<br /><br />If they can improve the quality on the Smart&Safe, it would be nearly perfect (needs its own volume control though). Unfortunately, it's way overpriced for something that only lasts a few weeks.",11/28/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gefen HDmi Detective Plus,Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,Works like a charm,"My setup is relatively simple. I have a media center pc that I use for both my regular TV and my theater room. The media center (Windows 7) had problems when I would switch from my TV to my projector. It was really frustrating because of course it happened most when I had guests over. Just switching the device from TV to project or back would frequently cause the media center to blue screen and die. Since I've installed this device I have had absolutely no problems with the media center. It always works when I need it do.

Etymotic Research HF2 Earphones / Headset (iPhone Compatible),Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,"On my third pair so far, and still madly in love with them...","Like the title says, I'm concurrently on my third pair. The first pair (purchased in late 2009) had a design defect in the headphonejack that broke the wires on the inside after about a years worth of use. A short email later I got a RMA number, returned the old broken pair and within about 2 weeks was sent what I'm assuming were a refurbished pair that had a redesigned headphone jack. These in turn worked great for a few months until they too stopped working. These also had a problem with the headphone jack, this time a material defect. A bit of exposed wire in the jack caused the sound to cut in and out. A short email later I was given another RMA number and sent a pair of BRAND new buds. So with all of tht in mind, how can I give these buds a five star rating?... Well tbw, they sound incredible! These are some seriously nice earbuds. The mids sound great, and unlike most contemporary buds the bass won't drown everything else out (not that there's anything wrong with the bass on these btw). These are some incredibly well balanced buds. They also drown out most ambient sound when in. I love the matte finish, and their inconspicuous design! They also come with a handy clip you can use to attach them to your shirt so they don't flap around when worn (that I broke after a while that they replaced for FREE!), have an inline mic, and Controls that work with almost any Android phone! As a Android user awash in a sea full of iOnly compatible accessories I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have accessory that's fully compatible with my phone of choice! So, in addition to some awesome sounding and looking buds (as evidenced by the countless other reviews I'm sure), the real killer feature that sets these these buds apart from any other in the same price range is the company that stands behind them. What other company would go to the lengths they did to honor their product like they did almost two years after my initial purchase? Not many I'm guessing, and that's whywhenever I need a new pair sometime in the future they'll be Etymotics.",1/4/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quality of sound is terrific and you don't need to turn the volume up until you lose your hearing to get good quality from these earbuds.

Peachtree Audio nova220SE Integrated Amplifier (High Gloss Black),Electronics,1,8,14,N,N,"I liked it a lot, until I had to send it back","I purchased this integrated amplifier/DAC in May 2014 to use with a Logitech Touch (squeezebox streamer) and PSB Imagine T2 Tower. I like it a lot, but right now it's on its way back to Peachtree to fix a failed pot in the volume control that was making noise. So apparently some design or quality issues, not at all what you'd expect at this price point. And the return via FedEx GROUND is a nice touch Peachtree. UPDATE: Eventually the amplifier arrived. The volume knob no longer makes noise, but there's intermittent static-y noise, even without a source connected, which was not there before. I'm returning it.",8/13/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YPbPr Component to VGA Video Audio Converter Adapter 1080p for PS2 PS3 Xbox Xbox360 WII Game Cube Connected to Computer Monitor Projector,Electronics,1,0,0,N,Y,Won't work for my needs,"Tried establishing a signal from my Wii to my computer monitor. It did not work. My monitor acts like it's receiving an intermittent signal, but the video is black(I used 2 different component cables by the way). I also bought an XCM VGA box, and ended up with the exact same effect. The Wii simply would not work with my monitor. I also tried hooking it up to another monitor. No such luck. I used a WDTV Live Plus, on the device to make sure it was working. It appeared to accept that signal, but would not accept the Wii's signal. I am familiar with the required settings for the Wii. E.g. 480P. It was not ignorance that kept me from achieving the goal. I may never know though. I plan to buy a Dell monitor that has integrated Component inputs :D I can't give it more than one star, because it's supposed to work with the Wii, yet it does not.

Yamaha 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers (Pair),Electronics,3,81,87,N,N,"OK for the money, some issues","The sound on these doesn't blow me away but is fine for outdoor patio use. They can get plenty loud and the price was definitely a good deal. I only really have had two issues thus far. First of all, if you plan on mounting these any way but straight off a wall, plan on purchasing additional mounting hardware. The instructions mention some sort of 'mega' bracket, which is a joke. I scoured the net and found others baffled by this phantom mounting device. Yamaha is doing a disservice to it's customers by even printing this in the enclosed documentation. I needed to mount these on the patio ceiling but did end up finding a great bracket that is sturdy and has quite a bit of flexibility. The bracket is item number 10776 from a1components.com. I'm sure you can find it elsewhere but it is very sturdy, made of metal and not plastic. Best of all it was only $13 per bracket. It did the trick for ceiling mounting. The other issue is the grills just fall off. After only about two weeks outside, the grills just dropped right off. I live in Texas but the speakers are completely out of the sun. I had to strap rubber bands around the speaker bodies to keep the grills on. It's not attractive but seems to work. It seems like a better design would include a simple clip in of the grills instead of using glue. The Yamaha engineers must not have tested the glue above 80 degrees F.",7/27/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qinpu - A-6000 MKII - Integrated /Headphone Amplifier,Electronics,5,6,7,N,Y,Excellent Deal,"Overall Impression<br /><br />I just picked one of these up based on the reviews on Amazon as well as a few reviews on here. And while I is a dual purpose integrated hybrid/tube amp and headphone amp, this amp really earns its money as the integrated amp. It does the headphone thing pretty good, but I have to be honest. I can not say that it is better than a properly configured Asus STX's headphone out, but its only marginally more expensive than the soundcard. But, I do not think I would be doing this thing justice without talking about its speaker driving abilities as an integrated amp. As an amplifier, most will rule it out due to its limited specs of 16.5 watts @ 8 ohms.Well, I have to say this things sounds better than two of my $800 Integrateds (NAD and Sony ES). If you have somewhat efficient speakers and not trying to fill a large room, this thing will drive speakers to loud but enjoyable volumes with ease. This is perfect for an office or bedroom. This thing has a tremendous soundstage and plenty of low end grunt, without sounding bloated for exaggerated, even through bookshelf speakers, Even with a flat eq setting on the STX, it sound full an balanced with the right amount of glassy sparkle with a touch of midrange complexity.<br /><br />Tubes<br /><br />These take 6N3 or equivalents. As for tube rolling, I feel a lot of people get caught up into it so much that they hear things based more on expectations than reality. Judging tubes is one thing that I feel I am more experienced in than a lot of people, as I've not only been using them for 30 years, I've also done a lot of tube amp repair work, as well as some building and modification for professional musicians. Although most of my experience is on the guitar amp side, I can assure you that guitarists are just as picky as audiophiles. I started out with the stock Chinese tubes, which appear to be Shuguang. I also bout about 4 sets of GE 5670W's. The thing people miss about tubes is that the tolerance for any manufacturer is all over the map. The output on one tube from the same maker can be up to 30% from the next tube of the line. If you have a tested or a reliable vendor that measures and tests tubes, I contend that a cheap tube that is strong and within spec with sound nearly as good as the expensive tube within the same specs. No guarantee just because its more expensive it will sound better. The other point I would like to make is that most designers design around evaluations done with a specific tube. So, they tweak according to what they are hearing with a specific tube. In my case I think the stock tube sounds better than the GE tubes. The GE tubes sound as if they have more gain, resulting in a little more boomy sound, but the stock tubes sound more natural to me. Both tubes have pretty small plates and seem quiet and free from microphonics.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I highly recommend this amp for a study or bedrooms. It's simple looks cool and sounds like an amp 3 times its price. I promise you that you will be surprised the sound that comes from this thing. As for the headphone amp, I think this may be overkill for just that. I rate is a very good, but not OMG good.<br /><br />FLAC -> Asus STX -> Qinpu A-6000 Mk2 -> Kimber 4VS Kables -> Dali Lektor 3 speakers",10/1/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),Electronics,4,0,0,N,N,Great sound and durable,"I have had these headphones for over a year after I tried out about 2 other pairs from different brands, both of which either sounded muddy or tinny. These headphones have clear sound and satisfying bass, for the price you really cant complain. I paid almost $30 for these at Circuit City and I would do it again. I take them with me everywhere and use them with my laptop, DS and portable DVD player. I listen to all sorts of music, everything from metal to dubstep and I dont have any complaints with how these deliver the sound. For sure they are the best in this price range, period. My only complaint is they do get uncomfortable, I wear them for hours on end occasionally (gaming or listening to tons of music) and when I take them off my ears really ache and are kinda numb. They lack good cushioning. Also, as some of the other reviews have mentioned, they do tend to move around a bit on your ears and can affect the sound but just a quick reajustment and they are back in full. I would recommend these headphones to anyone that casually listenens to music or just wants to watch some Youtube vids. If your gonna be wearing them for more than an hour or so then you will need to give your ears a break for a few minutes every now and then. The bottom line: for the price you cant beat them, love the sound, they are tough, look good and as long as you give your ears a rest occasionally they will be fine.",6/16/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"JBL Loft 30 Two-Way 4"" Bookshelf Loudspeaker - Pair (Black)",Electronics,5,14,17,N,N,Best Bookshelf Speaker in the <$50 category,"These are simple 2-way design with a 4&#34; midrange and 1&#34; soft some tweeter. These are a great example of what can happen when you take two modest components and execute the design with well chosen crossover points and enclosure design. You get a great sounding speaker with a surprising response in the low end, warm, detailed midrange and a clean upper register that after 4hrs did not produce a hint of fatigue that often plague the listener with lower end speakers. I was convinced that I would need to turn on the powered sub to round out the sound stage, but to my surprise this wasn't absolutely necessary with jazz, acoustic rock and blues. I'm not saying these speakers will produce tons of bass, but their well designed ported enclosure allows a much fuller low to midrange transition than a lot fo speakers I've demo'd that, despite significantly higher cost, are lost without the help of a subwoofer. So it's IMHO, that I would say these are the best bookshelf speakers I have heard in the sub $50 category. I've seen them at local big big stores with their &#34;promo codes&#34; in the sub $40 region and for that they are an absolute steal.",7/27/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Audio Technica Replacement Ear Pads for ATH-M40fs Headphones (Pair),Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,Taking Advantage of a Feature,"One of the selling features of the Audio-Technica (AT) headphone series is that the ear pads are replaceable. I suspect there are many users that considered that a &#34;nice-to-have&#34; feature, but not something they would ever cash in on. This particular set of headphones advertised flat response (fs). Accordingly they replaced a more expensive set of DJ headphones I had been using for pleasure listening since DJ headphones usually emphasize the bass. With the flat response of these ATH-M40fs, I have been able to use them for rough mixes. So much so, that (even with an acoustically imperfect room), I have figured out how to mix with these--and then afterward have developed a consistent tweak of the EQ for the masters. These headphones allow one to do rough to nearly final mixes (final mix with studio speakers, of course). Consequently, after considerable studio hours, the material covering the earpads started to disintegrate. How great not to have to replace the whole shootin' match when the headphones themselves are still kickin'! This set of headphones (and the replaceable earpads) are definitely one of my best studio purchases!",3/31/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sharkk 15W Bluetooth Wireless Speaker with Built-in Power Bank, 10 Hour Playtime, Single",Electronics,5,2,2,N,N,Solid Speaker/Power Bank - perfect for the category,"I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation. Of course receiving something for free may impact any review, but I can honestly say this is a solid product and worth the cost listed here. I have delayed my review a bit simply because I wanted to see if I would actually use and benefit from this Speaker. It has served its purpose on several occasions. I have used it in my office both as a charger and speaker. Packaging - shipped in solid packaging that was padded well, there is no way this should be damaged in shipping. Comes with the charging cable and a cloth bag for carrying and keeping from dust. Ease of setup - Charged it for the recommended time of two hours and easily got 8-10 hours of use before recharging. Powered up and started the pairing process, which connected without a hitch on the first try. Have not had any issues connecting via bluetooth at any point. I have not figured out the NFC option, but I am confident that is user error, and not really necessary. Buttons/Features - Has power, phone, play/pause, and volume or track buttons. I will say that everything works as advertised, but remembering the button combination to make things work takes a little bit of a learning curve. It is as simple as pressing or long pressing combinations, but if I had a complaint, I wish that I didnt have to think before pressing, but not a deal breaker. I like the ability to answer my phone while listening to music. This comes in handy when at the office and having hands free talking that seems to be clear enough. The sound through the speaker for calls is plenty clear, and nobody has complained when I have used this method to talk with them. Sound Quality - This is not a surround sound experience, and sound at maximum volumes isn't as rich as a high dollar audio system. (I have edited this portion of the review) The speaker is surprisingly loud, and I have yet to have a need to turn the sound all the way upother than for testing. All of my testing has been done with an LG G3 phone connected to the speaker, and a Asus Chromebook. I would rate the sound quality a 4 of 5 considering the size and a 3 - 5 if I was just rating pure sound quality regardless of price. I think it is important to consider what you are using. If I wanted a high dollar sound system, I would not be buying this device. For the market of portable bluetooth speakers I would say the sound quality is very good. Use as a Power Bank - I think this is probably the feature that has me most interested in buying a second unit. When at my office, my desk is small and the compact speaker size is great, add the sound from that compact space and the device is solid. Add to it that I can give my phone a fast charge when needed is a nice bonus. The manual also claims that you can connect more than one speaker together. I have a feeling I will be buying a second speaker to keep at home so this one can stay at my office. I will test this out and edit the review if I do end up buying a second one. I also will get a video review posted as time allows and after using it for a little longer. Overall, this is a quality device. I have bought a few other Sharkk products and so far I have not had any issues with their products. If you are looking for a speaker that is compact, practical, and provides powerful sound this is a worthy option. I use in a small office and a large living room and the sound fills the room well.",8/22/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I Use this speaker for personal training outdoors, and in a warehouse setting. Set-up was extremely easy and works great right from Pandora on my smartphone. The speaker gets loud enough for what I need but I Wouldn't recommend it for a very large area. The clarity is what impressed me the most. I would have expected this from a 100+ dollar speaker.

Zune HD Video MP3 Player,Electronics,5,9,11,N,Y,Zune HD - Best for music lovers!,"First I have to say that I am in Wow land. This Zune HD interface was designed to make discovering music fun. Swipe your finger tip up and down to scroll the text menu up and down. Select music, and tap into your favorite playlist. Tap play and start playing the playlist. Okay, easy enough but it gets very fun, read ahead see what I mean.<br /><br />Swipe down to the Radio. Add stations. If you hear a song you like, on the radio, add it to your cart. That's right, add a song you head on the RADIO to your cart. Hit the home button on the bottom to quickly escape the radio. Swipe down to Marketplace, select Cart, and the song you heard on the radio is in the cart. Download it and add it to your permanent collection.<br /><br />It get better. You can do this wirelessly because of the built in WiFi. Now, Sync your Zune HD wirelessly back to the PC to push the song you just downloaded to your PC. How awesome is that. Your Zune Pass Subscription means you can grab all the songs you want.<br /><br />Now, it gets even better.<br /><br />On your Zune HD, go to the Marketplace, and start to tap on songs. You can play them through your wireless WiFi. Okay? Songs you don't even have, you can play right off the market place via WiFi. Think about that for second. If you are home and on your WiFi network, you can listen to any of millions of songs, without downloading them!!<br /><br />Okay, say you find one you really like. Download it. It's all part of your Zune Pass.<br /><br />I have not even scratched the surface.<br /><br />QuickPick<br /><br />That text menu on the home screen? It's one of two menus on the home screen. Swipe to the left on that text. See how there is this small strip of icons on the left side. They become in focus and the large text shrinks off to the right. Now, this little list of icons is huge. Swipe up and down and cruise through the history of the songs you have been playing. Even the radio station you set is here in this history. This strip also contains a QuickPick. So what is a QuickPick?<br /><br />Say you are listening to song and you love it. You just found it on Marketplace and you want to listen to it over and over again until you're tired of it. How to find it easily? Well, tap and hold the album icon while the song is playing. A prompt window will appear and offer to pin the song into QuickPicks.<br /><br />As you explore for music on the radio or the Marketplace, completely wireless, you can easily find those songs again via the QuickPicks or History. That's what that little strip of icons are on the left side of the home screen. Fantastic huh?<br /><br />More fun stuff<br /><br />So I am listening to song and I see the album cover on the display. Tap that screen, and the album dims. A new dimension of menu overlays the album. It's a control surface. You see pause / play in the center. Up and Down are volume up and down. Left and Right are skip left or right. The upper top is to go back. Ignore it for second and it goes away returning the album art to view.<br /><br />The album / song you're playing has a small list under it. That's the songs coming up next! Tap on that little list and your in the list that this song comes from. You can now easily switch to other songs in this list.<br /><br />All of these menus and animated and fluid. It's actually fun to run around within this interface discovering music, adding it to quick picks and retrieving it. It's almost like a dance.<br /><br />Subscription music with the Zune Pass is such a great idea. And it really works with a device like this. Imagine all the ways to discover music, but keep the cost of enjoying all that music to a minimum. That's what the Zune accomplishes.<br /><br />There is so much more. Audible Books works with this. Though you do have to download Audible's Download Manager. I've listened to well over 200 books over the life of my Audible subscription.<br /><br />The Zune Marketplace software for the PC almost mirrors the features ofthe phone in that you can see your quick picks. You have a dashboard that shows you what's going on in your music world. And it gets this information from the device as well. As you add music, the whole ego system gets smarter and exposes you to more music you'll probably like. Absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />Think about it. You can add hundreds of songs a month if you like. Listen to them via radio, and download what you like. Listen live off the Marketplace from your PC or even your Zune portable. What ever you do with the Zune HD will sync back to the PC. In fact, there's more!! I know huh....<br /><br />So you have Zune software on your office PC too, okay... Listen to this. Go to Settings, Account, Subscription History. Remember, do this on your office PC, not your home PC so you really understand what's about to happen. Those songs you found on the radio, added to cart, and downloaded from the Marketplace are here in this history list even though this office PC had nothing to do with that. It's connected to your account so it knows. And you can, from your work PC, now download those songs to your work PC collection. It's subscription! You can have multiple PCs all connected to your account and they each aware of a collective history of subscribed to music. You don't have to carry songs with you on a thumb drive from your home PC to your office PC. Just let the Zune software show you the history. It tells you what is in your collection on that machine and what is not so you can update your office PC with those great songs you found on the radio or in the marketplace.<br /><br />Hey, do you like Tina Fey's 3rd rock? I sure do. You can download those TV shows as video and watch them on the Zune HD. They have movies too. For rent in SD and HD. I'm watching 21 grams.<br /><br />I have all the free games microsoft added to the apps section. By the way, you can download these from WiFi direct to the device!

So, I take out 1 point for the hefty price tag. Second, equlizer adjustments are badly missing. Few simple rock/pop/classic adjustments would have been added.

Creative Zen Mozaic Series MP3 Player,Electronics,4,1,1,N,Y,Great for price,"We've purchased many Zen products over the years and we like the small size and usebility of this model. The battery life is ridiculously long, MUCH better than the larger Zen M's but that's good because the only way to charge this little one is thru the USB (unless you purchase the charger extra I think). Zen's have been good products for us in general but they definitely have a shelf life. We don't handle them rough but accidents do happen so maybe it's that they've been dropped a certain way but each one just suddenly has stopped working at one point and it's been futile to troubleshoot it or reinstall the firmware. It's been frustrating and we are hopeful the Mosaics will last longer than the M's. We are not big users of the firmware for creating playlists and we would probably have an easier time if we learned how to use the software more effectively. But that's our own fault, not Creative's. My recommendation is that if you can get away with the smaller GB model like this 4gb Mosaic, the price and all it's other positive features makes it the perfect little Mp3. Would definitely buy another one if we were looking.",10/14/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JBL Balboa 10 Two-Way 5-Inch Bookshelf Speakers (Pair) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,3,35,44,Y,N,Nice size and good looks...,"I was excited to get these speakers and planned to add them to my system as a pair of back speakers to complement to two studio monitors and mid-size two-way speakers from Acoustic Research. I planned to drive them through my vintage Pioneer integrated amp.<br /><br />With all the power needed, I hooked up the speakers. They are very easy to connect - either with plain wire ends or connectors, simply thread the finger-nuts down tight and the speakers are connected with color-coded terminals.<br /><br />The front grills remove easily and snap back on positively.<br /><br />The black cabinets will go well with most systems.<br /><br />In short a good looking speaker that's easy to connect, and small enough to place in a number of locations.<br /><br />I turned on my amp and started playing a favorite CD. I'm sorry to say that the speakers were not pleasing to my ears. Keep in mind that speaker \\""sound\\"" is subjective. I have Infinity Reference series speakers in my cars, Acoustic Research studio monitors in my house (the old \\""real\\"" AR speakers), and Bose system for the \\""good\\"" TV in the family room. The sound I like is no doubt tied to my habit of listening to these speakers.<br /><br />I found the JBL Balboa to be hollow sounding. While crisp and clean, they are overly loud in the mid-range. The bass wasn't as solid as my other speakers.<br /><br />These are good speakers for low volume-level listening and would probably work as an element in a low- or mid-level surround-sound system as speakers for secondary sound. But placed in the middle of a high-end stereo system they were out of place. They're a good value for the price but don't expect to \\""Wow\\"" anyone with them.",10/28/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sony STR-DE895/B Receiver (Black),Electronics,1,5,35,N,N,After 7 years SONY has lost my business,"(Although the product is not exactly the same as my purchase, they are very similar; so take this review at that) I purchased the STR-DE995 7.1 &quot;Home theater&quot; receiver. After less than one year, it deteriorated into an overpriced stereo receiver. For your amusement, I attached the letter I sent to SONY of America's CEO. <br /> <br /> Mr. Howard Stringer, <br /> <br /> I am writing to inform you that your company has just lost my business. Over the years I have purchased many products from Sony and its subsidiaries, including a SONY Walkman, a Car Discman, 3 stereo receivers, a CD/DVD 5 disc changer, a WEGA TV, a PlayStation and its software, and DVDs and CDs distributed by SONY and its subsidiaries Columbia and Epic. <br /> <br /> With the recent purchase of the SONY STR-DE995 receiver, I experienced audio problems 9 months from the date of purchase. The chronology of action taken is outlined below. <br /> <br /> In an email, I wrote: <br /> &quot;Audio problem - When Dolby/dts (or any surround format) is selected a rhythmic, chirping noise is sounded through the center and rear speakers (currently have 5.1 setup). The noise is amplified as the volume increases. There is no recognizable noise when the receiver is in stereo <br /> mode (since the surround speakers are not enabled). I've tried the following connections: RCA analog, Digital Coaxial, and Digital optical. The receiver is stored in an entertainment center, and is connected to a SonicBlue ReplayTV DVR and Sony DVP-NC655P (both devices have the same sound output problem). The audio problem began about 2 weeks ago. No devices/cables/wires have been added or removed leading up to the problem. I've had no other problems with this device.&quot; <br /> <br /> Follow-up email from customer service stated the problem would need to be serviced. My reply: <br /> &quot;The service offered is very unsatisfactory. I treat and have treated all my electronic devices in excellent condition, and this productwas purchased less than a year ago (09/26/2003). The recommendation was to have it serviced. Since the closest Sony Service Center is over 2 hours away and the closest authorized center is 45 min away, I'd have to mail it to one of <br /> the centers. Figuring 2 business days to and from the center and about 3-5 days to be serviced (if it can be repaired at all); that would leave me without a receiver for at least 2 weeks. With the many years doing business with Sony, I expect its receiver to be fully operational for many years, not just 9 months. Also, the out of pocket expenses that would be charged at my expense to get the receiver to one of the service centers is not acceptable. <br /> <br /> I take a great deal of time researching the best products for the resources I have available to me; when I decide to purchase that product I not only expect the product to be exceptional, but the service as well. Therefore, since the product is under warranty, I want the STR-DE995 replaced with a new one, and I will ship the &quot;problem&quot; receiver to Sony at its expense.&quot; <br /> <br /> <br /> A 2nd follow-up email was sent stating customer service would need to be phoned. When I spoke with a rep this morning, he stated SONY's policy would not be able to honor my request as stated in the above email. When no progress had been made I requested to speak to the manager. He said he was the manager. I reiterated my request to speak to his supervisor. He then transferred me to a rep named Luke. He basically mimicked what the precious rep had told me; insisting policy must be adhered to. I continued the conversation stating, I expect perfection in the products I buy and the service that comes with that product. He replied that SONY equipment is constructed by humans and mistakes will be made. With that said, am I to believe that now and in the future I can expect less than perfect products from SONY? Even if my receiver is serviced, what's to guarantee there will beno other underlying problems? He didn't have the knowledge to answer my questions; instead he repeated the warranty policy. I went on to say, if SONY will not compensate me with a new receiver and pay for shipping costs, it will lose my business and will recommend to my friends and family to do the same. He told me I shouldn't base this decision on emotion, and tried to explain to me how businesses worked. I cut his rhetoric short by restating my position. He offered to fill out a service request. I said, you have lost my business and be sure to pass the message onto your supervisor. <br /> <br /> With the end of the conversation, the SONY Car Discman that I've been using at my workplace for the past 6 years went right in the garbage. I will not advertise SONY or any of its subsidiaries. I will not purchase any SONY product and encourage my friends and family to do the same. I will not buy advertising that supports the Spider-Man franchise or Columbia/Tri-Star films, nor those products advertised on Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!. Finally, until I have the resources, I will be replacing all my SONY products with non-affiliated brands.",8/6/2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will be ordering a new pair next week in any case, only because I love these headphones a lot, and want to know whether or not I accidentally broke my original pair somehow, or if it's a faulty product.

C2G / Cables to Go Audio Unlimited 900MHz Wireless Rechargable Stereo Headphones,Electronics,4,3,3,N,Y,Good Headset for the Price,"I must admit, I was a little worried by the reviews I read; seems a lot of people had trouble with these headphones. Thankfully, my experience has been compltely positive. I bought these because I have a new baby, and in the rare instance that I have free time to play a game, I didn't want it to wake her up. These are fantastic for gaming. The sound comes through clearly and- once you find the right channel & frequency- static-free. I will go so far as to say it even enhanced my gaming experience because I don't have surround sound, and with these stereo headphones I can now tell which direction a sound in the game is coming from. The range is fairly short, but if you're using it to watch TV or play video games that isn't a problem. One point of consideration if you're buying this for the same reason as I did: one of the channels (there are 3 total) is the same as our baby monitor (Graco), so it couldn't be used. Also, even on the channel that doesn't interfere, if I wear them into the room with the baby monitor microphone, there is substantial feedback. So there's probably no way to use them too close to the nursery. Overall, this is a fantastic product for the price; this headset is about half of what the other highly reviewed sets were ranging. I absolutley recommend them.",2/13/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver),Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,Great sound in a tiny package,"The IM-237 Orbit speakers provides very good sound with a wide dynamic range - from a tiny speaker in a package about the size of an orange. Great for presentations - you don't have to lug big speakers with you - or listening on an ipod. Far bigger, deeper sound than the built in speakers in my 17\\"" Macbook pro. If you are expecting this little device to sound like your home stereo system you'll be disappointed. But the compromise of small size, portability, low price and very acceptable sound makes the iM-237 Orbit well worth it. Battery life is OK. The cord wraps nicely around the base and the mini-plug stores into a recessed area on the base. However, at only 6\\"" long, it is maddeningly short.

They also have a great bass, sound quality is superior but if you want to spend on the $20 version for Wicked it's what you would expect out of ear buds for that price and much more bass and decibel intensity. Yes, the cords seem not to be the best but the sound quality is astounding!

The design, while the speaker-housings are strong & made of stainless-steel, the rest of the product cannot keep up with the sturdiness of the earbuds. The cable is not on parr, & separated from the mic/remote in the first week of use. Also, they were a little unwieldy, more so than other similarly shaped headphones I've owned...

Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player,Electronics,1,5,23,N,N,Worst electronic experience ever.,"I recieved the Zen Micro as a present and although I had never heard of it, I was excited to get a new MP player, and even more excited to get one that played 2,500 songs. <br />After recieving it, it took about an hour to download the software onto my computer and then 7 hours to fill my player with songs and create albulm for them. With the Creative media player that installs on your computer and takes over as the primary media player wether you want it to or not, the process of uploading music involves moving track by track and about a minute per song. <br /> <br />After getting about 800 songs on the player it was full, what Zen only writes in very fine print is that the player holds 2,500 WMPAs, which I had none of. Still excited to have a small player to put in my pocket on the treadmill, I headed out to the gym. After less than two minutes the player was broken. I tried rebooting it acording to the intructions, this involved awkwardly pulling out the battery and hitting some buttons, nothing happened. Also some of the aptions in the rebooting menu that pops up an not only wipe out your music, but wipe out all the firmware on the player, and because of the desighn of the virticle touch pad, accidently hitting on of these options is all too easy. <br /> <br />On the phone with Creative, they said they would replace it. Since my player was bought off of Amazon during the holiday season and I did not get it until two months later it was too late to return it to Amazon. <br /> <br />A month later I recieved my replacement. Again after spending the good part of the morning and early afternoon uploading my music, I headed off to work with my new player in hand. Then it happened again, this time I was running to catch the city bus when the player froze. Again nothing happened when I tried to reboot it. <br /> <br />Creative replaced it again becuase that was all they could do, they refuse to give me any type of refund. <br />I just recieved my third Zenmicro yesterday, oddly enough it arrived on the same day as my new IPod mini. The ipod took less than an hour to download the software (itunes)which had a much better interface even on my PC. Another hour later, itunes had uploaded 1,000 songs as promised to my IPod, which has proven to work wonderfully walking around, riding the subway, catching the bus, and yes working out at the gym. Also the circular pad is much easier to use tha the vertical pad of the Zen. The rebooting process also only involves hitting one button as opposed to opening up the player and giving yourself the oppertunity to wreck the whole thing. <br /> <br />Six months after first using the Zen Micro I am now happily part of the MP player carrying community with my new IPod mini. All I can say is that it's on top for a reason.",5/10/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sharper Image Sound Soother White Noise Machine,Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,Perfect,"I was dealing with bad insomnia for the past few months, and my efforts to wake earlier (so I'd be tired enough to sleep earlier) were not helped by me constantly sleeping through my alarm. I was looking for a clock with a few specific functions: 1. It had to have a gradual wake feature, as the shock from normal alarm clocks always left me groggy in the morning, 2. It had to be able to use some kind of nature sound as the alarm, simply because it's more pleasant to wake up to those than it is to a beep, and 3. It had to be lit with cool blue LED lights, because this is less jarring to look at at night, and the blue is more soothing to look at than the normal red LEDs, which just look ugly to me.<br /><br />It was really impressed with how many sounds there were on the clock (20), I didn't expect it to have that many. I've never heard the earlier model so I can't comment if the clarity was better with those, but the sounds are fine to use as an alarm. They are definitely not clear enough to use as a sound machine or sound soother; there is a lot of noise, like the sounds were recorded through a cheap microphone, or possibly the speakers are cheap. But since I did not buy the alarm clock to listen to, and just use it as an alarm, it personally did not matter to me.<br /><br />Some of the sounds are also pretty clear. I like to use the wind chimes sound as my alarm, since it's a gentle way to wake up, and the sound clarity is better than some of the other sounds like the ocean or the brook.<br /><br />It's very easy and straightforward to navigate the clock menus and set up the alarm. You can also program 2 alarms, which is a nice bonus! And you can set each alarm to go off everyday, every weekday, or every weekend day. I was impressed with how many features the clock was programmed with.<br /><br />My insomnia is also a lot better now, and this clock looks great on my blue desk! It had an unobtrusive yet slick and modern design, and the numbers have 3 levels of brightness that are all aesthetically pleasing. There is also a daylight savings time button on the back of the clock, so you can adjust that with the flick of a finger instead of programming it through the clock buttons manually.<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase and glad I bought it despite the negative reviews. :) There really wasn't any other alarm clock on Amazon that fit my criteria, and if they did they cost over $100 and there was no way I was paying that much for an alarm clock, so I'm relieved that the one clock that is reasonably priced turned out to be better than what I had been expecting.",6/4/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ART USB Phono Plus,Electronics,5,8,8,N,Y,WARNING,"I read almost all the reviews and agree with most of what's said. But I have a warning. First, my story. I bought this gadget to listen to and record the old albums I last heard back in the 80's. So I dug out my old Sony PS-X600 turntable (high end in its day), made all the connections to my home theater system, cued up \\""Innervision\\"" (by Stevie Wonder), and let rip. AWFUL! Sound quality was terrible!<br /><br />I started going through everything trying to find the problem. After all, I was an audiophile back in the day and I should have the know-how to troubleshoot this mess. Well, I found it. The moving magnet style M97 Shure cartridge, which was high end in its day, was shot. I replaced it with a new one (got a great deal here on Amazon), and then WOW I got blown away by Stevie singing \\""Superstition.\\"" Then I cranked up Pat Benatar, then Spyro Gyra then Chicago Transit Authority. All sounded fantabulous!<br /><br />For all you baby boomers out there, the warning is this -- just because your turntable spins the record it still might need a new cartridge or a new stylus. The sensitive internal stylus parts degrade and deteriorate over time even if you never use the turntable. So if you buy this Art Preamp and the sound quality sucks, check your cartridge, people!",6/24/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much better material than other ankle sleeves I've tried, it seems very solidly made. Support is okay, but you shouldn't depend on an ankle sleeve for support. Inversion sprains are just as likely--you need a sturdy lace-up ankle brace to prevent those. This is for warmth and compression, similar to why bikers wear spandex tights. Support seems better than ankle sleeves with an open heel though, however, the top part of this ankle sleeve digs into the top of my ankle bone, where it creases when I dorsi-flex my ankle. So its uncomfortable when I run with it on.

Omron Body Composition Monitor with Scale - 7 Fitness Indicators & 90-Day Memory,Health & Personal Care,2,0,2,N,Y,Is it demotivational or dysfucntional?,"I was very excited to purchase the Omron Full Body Comp Scale. It appeared to be state of the art and with its 4 point of contact I was hoping for extremely, or more accurate body fat numbers. In 24 hour spans there were BODY FAT swings of 4% or more. I know from being involved in fitness that these types of swings are highly improbable, some would say impossible.<br /><br />The scale also has an \\""Age\\"" feature, which uses an algorithm that produces your \\""Body Age\\"". As someone who trains 5 days a week and engages in a very active lifestyle my \\""Age\\"" was consistently 80 years old!<br /><br />I am starting to believe that our technology just is not yet available to offer a cost effective methodology of accurately measuring body fat. I have used Omron before and they get high grades in construction and durability. My hope was for a device that if not record accurate BODY FAT measurements at least record consistent records so you could gauge if you were moving in the right direction. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />So there is frustration in trying to gauge my actual fitness levels using this scale - though it does appear to run a true and accurate body weight. Additionally, while the body age feature was an attractive lure for motivating me to get back to High School fitness level it would appear to have the opposite effect and rather than getting fitted for my High School Letterman Jacket had me thinking of getting fitted for dentures and depends!",12/30/1899,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Bort KubiTal Padded Elbow Bursitis & Tendonitis Sleeve,Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,Y,Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Sufferers Will Like This Sleeve,"I am in search of the ideal elbow sleeve to relieve the pain of cubital tunnel syndrome. When the sleeves provided by my physical therapist came up short when it came to pain relief, I decided to try this sleeve. So, here goes with what I like about this sleeve: - It is sturdy. - Generous gel padding helps protect the ulnar nerve from being aggravated and causing the pain. - Sleeve fits snugly and doesn't move around on the elbow. - Sleeve fabric quickly adjusts its fit to your arm instead of forcing your arm to adjust to it. - Offered in a nice, blue color along with beige. Now for the nits to pick: - It is pricey (but what cost is too much if it does the job well?) - Make sure you select the right size! The way Bort Medical sleeves, braces, and other devices are listed in Amazon does not include a size selection from within one web page. You have sift through all of the Bort Medical items available on Amazon (17 pages of information according to my searches) to find the product you want with the size indicated in its Amazon listing title. - Develops a funky smell after one day of use.

"California Baby Hair De-tangler Spray - Calming, 8.5 Ounce",Health & Personal Care,3,13,16,N,N,"This did help add shine and definition to my baby's hair when it was short, but it doesn't help de-tangle.","I purchased this product last spring to help de-tangle my toddler's hair. Back then, she was only 14 months old and still had short (but curly) hair. Even then, this didn't really help us comb out the tangles in her hair. It DID help define her curls once her hair was already combed, plus it did add shine - which was nice. I followed the directions on the bottle and used this when her hair was still wet. I also tried using a conditioner first and also tried using this when her hair was dry. It still didn't help de-tangle.<br /><br /> Now that she's 22 months old, she has hair that goes almost down to her shoulders when it's wet. Her hair is fine and she has lots of tight Little Orphan Annie curls. With her hair now being longer, this stuff no longer does anything for it at all. In fact, I'd say that it even dries her hair out. After using this, her hair turns into a frizzy mess in a matter of hours. Her hair seriously looks better WITHOUT this product in it.<br /><br /> I do love that the ingredients are safe and this stuff also smells fabulous. The bottle lasts a long time. I really do wish it would work. However, I've now switched over to using California Baby Calendula Conditioner in her hair to help tame it - and that does work wonderfully - but I'm still hoping to find a natural de-tangler that actually does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />* (I use Earth Mama Angel Baby or California Baby shampoos on my baby. I use either Healthy Times or California Baby conditioner. I have very soft water and only wash my baby's hair a couple times per week. The only reason I mention this is to point out that my baby's hair care routine isn't overly harsh, so it shouldn't be making this product ineffective.)",11/12/2011,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

So, I decided to buy Pedi.Cure for my wife to try it out in hopes that maybe she could use it every once in awhile to supplement the spa visits. After one use, she was hooked! She would not stop talking about how great it made her feet feel and how happy she was that I bought it for herâ€¦ Which was good for me! She kept insisting that I needed to try it because I was having pain in my feet from running. Finally, I gave in and tried Pedi.Cure. I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase! I am ordering another one just so I can have my own because my feet are nasty. I will say, if you use too much pressure, it will not work as well. You need to lightly run the roller over the problem areas on your foot repeatedly and it will gently smooth out all dead and callused skin. My wife and I used the Pedi.Cure so much that we needed to order extra roller heads which arrived within days and were just as good as the first.

"Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein, 1.95 lb.

Cookies N Cream is easily the best flavor for this particular brand, which isn't saying much because the rest of the flavors a completely horrid. However, to this flavors credit, it does taste a little bit like the flavor that's labeled on the container.<br /><br />Despite what many people might think because of its price tag, Body Fortress is a high quality protein source and the fact that its Whey products are 52-60 grams of protein every two scoops is really impressive. The only problem that has plagued this product, is once again, the taste. This is really the only flavor from their Whey Protein Powder line that is actually somewhat easy to chug down, because the regular Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla and the awful Chocolate and Peanut Butter are not.<br /><br />So overall, this is the only flavor that gets a passing grade from me.",6/27/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I've put things in the washer thinking that with liquid soap I would always pre-treat a stain. Not needed so far - all our clothes come out clean and stain free.<br /><br />One user commented on the nuggets being hard. That is true for me as well. I put a nut cracker in the box of nuggets and just crunch up each nugget before I use it. It may not be a problem for machines where you add soap with the clothes. I use a front loader with a dispenser and we have had hardened chunks that did not completely dissolve. I'm able to crunch the nuggets with the nutcracker and it doesn't burst the outer pack.

Unfortunately grapefruit seeds do not have natural antimicrobial properties.<br /><br />The FDA and DEA have issued MANY warnings to the manufacturers of &#34;Citricidal&#34; in the last few years because these products are heavily contaminated with benzalkonium chloride. What exactly is this chemical? Well you may already know it as HAND SANITIZER.<br /><br />I can't speak for the purity of liquid extracts, but the powders are most heavily contaminated. Please read the industry trade article below:<br /><br />http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Suppliers2/Expert-dismisses-grapefruit-seed-extract-false-positive-explanation<br /><br />TL;DR - one of the manufacturers stated that Citricidal is the same molecular weight as BZK, giving a false positive test result.

"Now Foods Sunflower Lecithin Non GMO, 1200mg, Soft-gels, 200-Count",Health & Personal Care,5,33,40,N,Y,"Good quality supplement, no side effects","I can't claim that taking the recommended 3 softgels daily (3.6g) was responsible for any measurable memory improvement, weight loss or lower cholesterol but I can say that doing so didn't hurt at all. While the benefits of Lecithin are being debated and research is ongoing, I am happy with NOW's product because it has no 'bad' ingredients such as sugar, corn starch, salt, yeast, wheat, gluten, corn, milk, egg, shellfish or preservatives. NOW also states that their product is GMO-free - a good thing.<br /><br />Given the suggested serving size of 3 softgels, the 400 quantity should last for about 4 months if taken as suggested. The gels are easy to swallow and, since this Lecithin is extracted from soybeans, there is no aftertaste and I haven't experienced any digestive trouble.<br /><br />I am unaware of any negatives other than the lack of consensus on Lecithin's actual effectiveness but for a 'food supplement', not a miracle cure, this is a good product.",4/26/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EZ Tactile Long Ring Timer,Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,Y,Second one in household,"I fly remote control planes and needed a timer I could hear when measuring flying times and battery discharge.

Since I am hard of hearing, the long, loud ring on this timer is just perfect. All those digital timers with their little beep beep beeps were out of the question.<br /><br />This timer fits my needs perfectly. Easy to read, easy to set, and easy to hear. The only negative is that it is one minute off. For example, you must set it for one minute longer than the time you want to measure. This is not a problem for me. Maybe it's just in my timer. My wife's is accurate. I would definitely recommend this timer to anyone. You don't have tobe a rocket scientist to operate it.

We use them on top of the changing pad so we don't have to wash the cover every time there is an accident. We also carry them in the diaper bag so any couch (or lap) can be turned into a changing pad.<br /><br />The second time around, I ordered similar pads from another seller because I assumed they'd be the same and those were a little cheaper. Turns out, they are a little different. We like this brand better because it's softer and seems a little more absorbent. Not a huge difference though, sort of like a preference in paper towels - at the end they all do the job.<br /><br />Update: Now that our little one is a year old, we don't go through these pads quite as fast. They are still a must on our changing table. Our baby is very squirmy and sometimes it's hard to keep all the mess inside the diaper. If it wasn't for these pads, we'd have to have several changing pad covers and wash they much more frequently.",2/23/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Be forewarned: programming is complex, so it helps to have some geeky experience, and even at that it takes a good twenty minutes or more of patient work.

"Babyganics Foaming Dish and Bottle Soap, 16oz Pump Bottle (Pack of 3)",Health & Personal Care,5,1,1,Y,N,Foam Makes It Easy To Use. Rinses Off Quickly With No Residue.,"We have this dish soap in both the citrus scent and unscented varieties. I prefer the unscented kind. My sister, on the other hand, prefers the citrus scent. So I guess your preference will depend on if you like a scent to make things smell fresh or if you'd rather have less &#34;soapy&#34; smell. There is no residue left on the dishes after I use this unscented soap, and I love not having them smell like soap or fragrance of any kind.<br /><br />As for use, my sister and I are both loving the product. When I first put it in the kitchen, my sister kept making unsolicited comments about how much she loved it, so that makes it a winner in this household. No babies here, but we like to use products made for babies because we are sensitive to harsher ingredients. I especially love the foaminess of this soap. It's so easy to use just a little bit for quick cleanup of a dish or two, and it rinses clean without having to use scalding hot water. Definitely recommended.",2/10/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker,Health & Personal Care,3,0,0,N,Y,data held hostage; sporadically counts severely excessive flights of stairs,"three issues:<br /><br />(1) your raw data is locked into the fitbit online service unless you pay $50/year for the premium service to unlock it. in terms of owning the data about yourself this is a really unfriendly policy.<br /><br />(2) could just be my device, but i've found that after it has been in use for 5 days+ without a full reset it will start to claim that i've climbed a flight of stairs every ~100 steps even on level ground. this causes me to end up with 100+ flights in a day which is really annoying because you can't remove just the stairs from your activities.<br /><br />after much searching i learned how to reset the device and now when i charge it i deliberately reset it (you plug it into the USB charger and hold the button for ~10s and it will power off, then you release and press the button again to power it on). when i reset it like this i also notice that it also seems to recalibrate its battery charge indication, and is frequently more empty than it was showing prior to the reset.<br /><br />in case it helps fitbit folks mine claims to have FITBIT 6.60 when it powers up.<br /><br />(3) (2014-07-12 edit) in the span of 3 days fitbit awarded me the 1000 floors badge and the 2000 floors badge, and the above bug (2) didn't even occur during this period: nothing on my tracker indicates i climbed 1000 floors.",7/5/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seemed like a secure fitting clip but somehow, (maybe the getting in and out of my car), it shimmied loose and went AWOL..<br /><br />Luckily, based on the last time it synced and knowing where I generally was at that time, I was able to zero in on where it might have detached and amazingly lucky for me I called the Office Depot that I had been perusing around that time and they actually found it and put it aside for me!! VERY LUCKY!<br /><br />I have since engaged my trusty Brother label maker and affixed my cell # to the back of the device and inside the clip to hopefully help it find it's way home should it ever happen again...<br /><br />If it was lost, for me, I was not going to spend another $90 unless there is a better designed belt clip...<br /><br />Over all a great tool to keep track of your fitness and to get an idea of your sleep pattern.",5/1/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EatSmart Products Precision Getfit Digital Body Fat Scale with Auto Recognition Technology,Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,Y,"Slick Design, Accurate Weight Measurement, but Body Fat % Off","There are hundreds of reviews on Amazon about this scale, and they are overwhelmingly positive, which is why I chose this particular brand and model. After two weeks of use, here is my summary:<br /><br />Design: Perfect! Sleek, modern, light weight, and super thin. Now I just need to by a modern loft downtown to put this thing in! Did Apple design this scale?<br /><br />Weight Measurement: Perfectly accurate and delivers a very quick reading, less than three seconds. What more could I ask for?<br /><br />Body Fat Measurement: Relatively accurate, but needed to be calibrated by adjusting the height of the individual. This was a bit of a disappointment. After programming the unit for myself and the wife, my body fat reading was at least 10% off, reading much less than my actual body fat. Unfortunately, I knew what my body fat % was, so I couldn't be blissfully ignorant and content with the 14% reading, which is optimal health. My wife, on the other hand, was off about 5% in the other direction. In the time it took for the scale to be delivered, she got 5% fatter!! WTF? I emailed EatSmart, and they replied within hours, giving me instructions to change our heights in user program. This will either slow down or speed up the electrical signal to align the measurement with what we knew our actual body fat percentages are. From here on out the scale will be calibrated correctly and the measurements accurate. So far so good, over the two week period or percentages have remained constant, as expected.<br /><br />Other Measurements: Water, Bone, & Muscle. These are just bonus numbers to me, all I am really concerned with is weight and body fat. The numbers seem to fall in line with what I would expect from the charts listed in the user manual, but I really don't pay too much attention to them.<br /><br />Overall: After the adjustment to the body fat settings, I am happy with the scale, and I love the step on technology; no buttons to push or taps needed. I deducted one star for the body fat issue, otherwise this would be a solid five star scale.",9/6/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,
USA SELLER _ToysHeart Bordeaux by [ CoolMaleSexToy ],Health & Personal Care,3,1,2,N,Y,Layers are very fragile!,"I was initially pleased by the quality and texture of the toy, not to mention the suction is an absolute plus compared to others. However, cleaning it proves to be difficult, as the only way it will dry is if you manually reverse it and hand-dry with a towel. It will not air-dry, which is important in maintaining longevity and preventing other things from accumulating (think of hair/fuzz from a towel, etc). I left it hanging upside down in an open, airy room for a full day and it was still damp. Not good.<br /><br />That minor detail aside, however, the real dilemma is the way the inner lining is formed. The outside is a thick pink mold, whereas the inside is a very thin sleeve bound along the edge of the sleeve itself. Within a week of very minimal use, the inner sleeve started to detach from the wall of the outer mold. Now there is a gap between the two layers that lets water inside (when cleaning) and is impossible to dry or clean out. It also slides and detracts from the experience of using the sleeve. The more it is used, the more it detaches. If I really wanted to, I could just slide my finger to the bottom between the layers and detach it entirely and remove it. Unfortunately it is this inner sleeve that provides the texture so that is a major issue.<br /><br />The fragile state is worrisome, as I cannot get much use out of the toy since purchasing it originally. It took little use to degrade to its current state, though I'm sure it is just a fluke in my particular unit's molding. Others seem to enjoy their sleeves, so I would be hopeful that anyone that purchases it has a better experience than me.",1/5/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Douglas LaboratoriesÂ® - B-Complex w/ Metafolin - Supports Blood Cells, Hormones, and Nervous System* - 60 Capsules",Health & Personal Care,1,25,33,N,Y,contains a supplement derived from pig,"Says vegi caps but that is misleading. Only the capsule is vegan. This supplement contains intrinsic factor derived from pigs (porcine). Intrinsic factor is produced by the stomach and is essential to the assimilation of B12. Some people need intrinsic factor supplement because they no longer produce intrinsic factor in sufficient quantities to assimilate B12. Yet I fail to understand why a company would bother to create and advertize a vegi cap when contents are derived directly from animal. On the positive side, the B vitamins are phosphates or methyls -- no oxides. That is very good and, truthfully, very hard to find. Despite being a vegan, I'm going to finish these vitamins because I'm not a total fanatic. But they get one star for misleading description. How many people even know what porcine is? I knew but missed the fine print. So, I recommend these B vitamins if you really need intrinsic factor with your B12.",6/30/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination did allow me to return to a more youthful energy level but it didn't take long for me to notice a side effect I didn't expect... I have lost 17 lbs since January 8th and have not restricted my food intake in any way. I have also not excersized at all. I am now at my ideal weight for my height and my bmi is also appropriate. (I had given up and figured the extra weight went along with my increasing age) I have continued to take the supplements to help with general health and energy levels for an additional 6 wks. I have not continued to lose weight. (which is good cause if I did I would be under weight by now)<br /><br />Before taking these supplements I never drank water. I mostly drank coffee and mt. dew. Since taking the supplements I find I don't need or want the extra sugar and caffeine; I actually want water.

Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Diapers (Pack of 4),Health & Personal Care,5,2,2,N,Y,What they say is true ...,"There are some other reviewers who have noted that the newborn diapers aren't so great. I have to agree. We tried the newborns and they were a disaster so we switched to Huggies Pure and Natural. The Huggies worked great but were so expensive that we decided to go back to the 7th Gen when our baby got big enough for the size 1 diapers. Now he's on to size 4 and we've had no complaints. The only \\""leaks\\"" we've had were from the crazy blowouts that I don't think any diaper could have contained. So, to sum it up, if you're reading this review then you obviously care about things like chlorine free diapers, environmental impact, etc and if you care about those things then you certainly can't go wrong with these 7th gen diapers as long as you stay away from the Newborn size.",8/11/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer,Health & Personal Care,5,5,5,N,N,Best gadget I've ever bought,"I spent 1 year thinking about this scale: &#34;Is it acurate? Do I really need the wi-fi? Is it worth the money?&#34;<br />And I came to the following conclusion:<br />- It's the most beautifull scale I've ever seen<br />- The weight it's super accurate - It measures till 0.01kg - not that I need it, but it's good to have that precision.<br />- It's the most simple thing to use in the whole world - You just step on it, and it reads your weight, body fat %, and BPM. And at the end it recognizes you and sends the data to your account. Currently 5 people use my scale and the scale works perfectly.<br />- The Wi-Fi, THE WIFI - This is the thing that makes it all worth it. The ease! The simplicity. This saves you so much work. At first it may seem useless, but when you use it... I fell so good seeing my progression from this last 3 months (when I bought the scale).<br />I can see my everyday weight from this last 3 months; and because I track my calories too, I can make a correlation and figure out what is working with me and what is not.<br />- I dont really need the BPM but it's nice too see mine slowing down as I keep doing cardio and geting used to it.<br />- The Health Mate Website is super clean, and shows you everything you need to see with precision and beauty.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend it to EVERYBODY. It could be a bit cheaper, but the scale is great and a good investment. It improves your life quality easily.",6/22/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has been having a bit of trouble with incontinence at night while sleeping. These Depend Guards for Men are just what the doctor ordered. Literally, the doctor said he should get these. Because he's embarrassed about his problem, we had to get them for him and show him how to use them.<br /><br />These are a thick, absorbent product that fits men well. The guards are shaped like underwear and have an adhesive strip that holds them in place in your underwear. They stay put well and are absorbent enough to capture and hold almost any accident, day or night. The package contains 52 guards for protection day and night. They are not noticeable when worn in the underwear. They work in boxer-briefs and briefs. They do not work well in standard boxer underwear.<br /><br />This is a great product that just work right out of the package. They are absorbent and do not show when worn correctly.<br /><br />**I purchased this product at full price for personal use.",6/29/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large Zip Glasses Case,Health & Personal Care,5,8,11,N,Y,Nice Case,"I am very pleased with my purchase of this case. I really like them. The cases are a firm. Curved glasses like safety glasses fit into these cases. I order some Dewalt Safety Glasses from Amazon and I noticed a pair listed that had a smoked lens (Dewalt DPG58 2C). Also another pair that said indoor/outdoor (Dewalt DPG58 9C). I ordered both along with regular safety glasses. So the reason I am putting this here is the glasses are rather large in the way they curve back deeply. A regular flat case will not hold them. This case works great but the safety glasses just fit snuggly in this case. If you think your glasses may be larger then I recommend \\""Eyewear Safety Glasses Case Belt Hook Zipper\\"" From ERB. The ERB case is soft cover and is larger. For an idea of the size of glasses these cases will hold look up the safety glasses I listed.",6/10/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can set the sensitivity of this feature depending on how loud the music is that you're listening to.<br />It comes with a battery pack with the controls on it, and it has a long cord that makes it easy to hide the battery pack in a pocket or backpack etc. I definitely recommended these if you're a night goer, or go to a lot of parties.

It's not noisy. It seems to work just fine. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't seem to refill it without leaving a small trail of dripping water (but nothing egregious), and although it says that it's suitable for a room of 500 sq ft, it doesn't seem like the steam travels that far from the humidifier. But this is my first humidifier, so maybe those things are typical.",2/2/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herbalife Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix,Health & Personal Care,1,5,9,N,N,Herbalife for me = hormonal disaster,"I got 2 packages of herbalife formula 1 when I started a weight loss challenge, french vanilla, and cookies n cream. The &#34;cookies&#34; in cookies n cream were gross, and they all sunk to the bottom of my cup. Both mixes were clumpy unless mixed in a blender. I had 2 shakes a day with protein-rich snacks, a nutritious dinner, drank lots of water, exercised, and cut out sweets. I lost a grand total of 1.5 pounds. I was also in a very foul mood the whole time I was doing this challenge despite eating better and exercising. Come to find out, herbalife shakes are made out of soy protein, and soy disrupts your hormones. A disruption in hormones for me meant I was sad, very irritable, and tired. I wish I would have done some research on soy before I made it such a big part of my diet. I will not be purchasing any herbalife products again and certainly don't recommend it.",2/27/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

100 Grams (3.53 Oz) Phosphatidyl Serine Bulk Powder,Health & Personal Care,4,16,16,N,Y,More detailed product specifications would be useful,"This is a decent value, however buyers should be aware that the product is only 20% by weight of phosphatidyl serine (PS). I believe that the seller should clearly state this. (This product is derived from soy beans, and the remaining 80% consists of other phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline.) (NOTE: 20% strength is typical for PS powder; other commonly available strengths are 50%, and 99%; most PS supplements in capsule form use a 20% strength powder). What this means is that for each 500 mg of powder, you are getting 100 mg of PS. Thus 100 grams of this PS powder gives you 20 grams of actual PS, which is equivalent to a bottle of 200 capsules each containing 100 mg PS. With this powder, you are paying ($35.55/200) = $0.18 per 100 mg of PS. For comparison, the best value bottle of PS I could find on iherb (Doctor's Best, Best Phosphatidyl Serine, 100 mg, 120 Veggie Caps, $31.98) worked out at around $0.26 per 100 mg serving. So with this powder, you ARE saving money (18 cents versus 26 cents per 100 mg serve). There are other advantages to powder over capsules/ softgels. Powders can be sprinkled on foods or blended into smoothies. I like to blend my PS powder in my whey protein drink for example. Regarding storage, I tip the entire pack of powder into a plastic tub with an airtight lid, and store it in the fridge. If you keep it chilled, it's possible to take a spoon of the powder and sprinkle it into e.g., a smoothie without the powder sticking to the spoon.",2/25/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magic Wand Massager,Health & Personal Care,5,5,7,N,Y,THIS THING IS INCREDIBLE...but it's a little rough with frequent use.,"When you purchase the Hitachi, you've got to know what you're getting. You're not getting one of those novelty vibrators that'll work for about 100 uses (six months at best) and then putter out or otherwise breakdown. You're also not getting a regular vibrator, with service vibrations simply do the trick. The Hitachi is incredibly powerful, packing up to 6000 rpm on the high setting, its reputation is very good and it will last in all likelihood a large portion of your sexual life. We're talking years, and decades if you care for it well. In addition, the vibrations that the Hitachi provides are not only powerful, but penetrating and deep. It woke up parts of me that I didn't know were there. It's funny because I thought that the sheer vibrating power of the Hitachi would make me less sensitive and stop me from enjoying my partner as much. Wrong. If anything, it was a sexual aid and made me more sensitive and responsive to my partner, and even other vibrators. I've had my Hitachi for 4 months, and at the beginning I didn't like it as well because it \\""worked\\"" so quickly that there was no build up. But after spending a few months with it, it's hands down my favorite toy. Also, amazon's pricing is a steal for what you're getting; other websites or sex shops sell the Hitachi for as much as $50. The one thing to watch out for, and the one downside, is that although it is a machine with incredible, deep vibrations and last power, the material isn't really built for sensitive tissues, and it shows. It's made out of vinyl and with frequent use, even if that's just every couple days or so, it tends to irritate skin. Even so, it's worth the buy and putting a condom over the head or buying an inexpensive attachment (I just ordered the natural contours g-spot attachment) you can make an awesome toy damn near perfect.",7/26/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the temporary down side being new to this it takes a bit of getting used to, namely; having to get it placed correctly, knowing how much time can pass before checking it, and finding the right insertion fold that's comfortable for you.

NOW Sports 25Oz 3-In-1 Sports Shaker Bottle,Health & Personal Care,4,1,2,N,Y,"Update to ""Not a 3 in 1 bottle"" review","Update: Well it turns out I did receive the wrong bottle. I'm not sure if that's the fault of Amazon or Online Healthy Offers. That being said, I can't praise Online Healthy Offers enough for correcting the mistake. I received an e-mail and a phone call from them and they rushed out the correct bottle and a prepaid return postage sticker for the wrong bottle.<br /><br />The correct bottle is a little on the large side. However, the powder container can be stored inside the bottle when storing in a cupboard. Supplements/vitamins can be stored in 2 compartment in the purple lid behind the drinking spout. The powder container has a purple lid that then screws onto the bottom of the orange bottle (although it screws on in the opposite direction) This bottle does have markings for 25 ounce. Overall I think it's a good value for the money.<br /><br />Pros: A true 3 in 1 bottle with 25 ounce markings, good value<br />Cons: Bottle is a little large<br /><br />Original Review: I purchased the 3 in 1 Sports Shaker Bottle. That's how it was advertised and that's how it's labeled on the product but that's not what I got. I got a simple shaker bottle. It's just like any other shaker bottle. There's no bottom mounted powder container or vitamin compartment. The bottle is clear not orange as advertised. It's a 25 ounce bottle but the markings only go up to 20. I don't know if I received the wrong product because it doesn't look like their posted picture and isn't a 3 in 1 despite how it's labeled.",7/3/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant Fusion Diet Supplement,Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,N,One of the Best Protein Supplements,"This has to be one of the best plant source, if not the best natural protein source supplements, out there on the market in powder form.

Not to mention the Amino Acid profile is rather extensive.<br />Plain is a staple as you can add your own flavors fruits or veggies and add it to baked goods or savory soups easily. My favorite is to add Raw Cacao powder, coconut/hemp oil and a bit of cinnamon and cardamom for a nutritious morning shake.<br /><br />For those sensitive to sugars the Fructose can be the kicker (thus my 4 star rating).<br /><br />I put this into rotation with some other protein supplements (hemp and egg white mostly) to change things up a bit.<br /><br /><3",12/12/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Night Splint Foam fit w/Tread Large,Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,Y,Very Pleased,"After two years of trying various orthodic insoles to deal with plantar fasciitis pain, I finally went an Orthopedic who put me in one of these.

The exact item and brand. I bought another one. Recommendation for wearing: if you sleep on your back your toes will point at the ceiling. This item does a great job of allowing that, as it protects your toes from getting crushed by the covers that are too tight. I wore mine loose and never tightened the side tension straps. My foot ached the first few nights so I would take it off. If you roll around in bed your other foot might get banged up a little bit (think about walking around in one ski boot) which is why I bought a second one.

Jillian Michaels Fat Burner 56 Cap,Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,Y,Love this Jillian Fat Burner!,"I have been taking this product for 2 years now (off and on of course, can't over do it) and I managed to lose 30 lbs. in the first 1 1/2 - 2 mos.! Then I slacked off and took maybe 2 pills a day and gradually added back in a little more food. I did quit junk food altogerther. But later (and It took a while to even have craving again,surprisinly) I could add in a tiny snack and be fine. I even in the beginning cut down to 1-2 meals a day... I know that's bad, but honestly I'm so used to it anyway cause I have digestion issues. but later I did start adding in like 3-5 really small meals with no issues and no weight gain. This is THE ONLY PRODUCT of like the 20+ I've tried that actually works! And I also like, unlike most, it doesn't make you jittery or headachy or sick..however, on me I have found if I don't eat at least a couple bites when I take it, it tends to make me feel sick. but mostly, i'm fine. Also, after a couple weeks or so I will start feeling sick so it's my cue to hold off a while. I usually, just to maintain weight, take 2 a day for about a week then take a week off sometimes more. So yeah, definitely watch how much you take for sure...don't go overboard. If you stay in low doses and take breaks, it doesn't make me sick or jittery. In the beginning or every now n then when I need to lose a poumd or two I've gained, I take 4 per day. but go down after few days. I also used the Jillian cleanse first too. and every few months I'll take a few days of it just to get rid of some bloat.. It also works really well...not harsh like a laxative. It's a gentle, maybe frequent, normal like, over a couple days kind of thing. I RECOMMEND JILLIAN FAT BURNER. Oh, but stay away from the red bottle one. I've gotten it in by mistake(?) once and I tried it but it didn't do squat! Not even a mild energy., The white bottle like this one does give you a &#34;just right&#34; energy unless of course you take too much you'll notice your heart rate go up!",6/16/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Source Naturals MSM Cream (Pack of 2),Health & Personal Care,5,25,29,N,N,"Started using this for skin elasticity, will continue to use it for other reasons","I came across more than one online person claiming that MSM in soap bars and creams helped their skin rebound after weight loss. As someone who is restarting a diet (after losing 32 pounds and maintaining for more than a year), I want to see if it helps with elasticity issues (anyone who has lost a lot of weight knows what I mean...that stretched out and unappealing look of skin that was expanded with fat and is deflated with fat loss). I'll update if I notice improvements by next year (by which time I hope to be down anothe 32 lbs).<br /><br />I do find that it has a nice absorbent, creamy, moisturizing quality. I use it on upper arms, belly, bosom and thighs (I use fragrance free sensitive skin moisturizers elsewhere, except feet, where I like to use perfumed lotions). It absorbs fast and leaves skin nicely soft. Not greasy at all. If it gets in the bloodstream and helps joints, all the better. (I will be starting to take the MSM powder for my aging knees and ankle joints which often hurt after exercising).<br /><br />The scent is light to medium-light (not heavy or annoying) and is herbally (probably from the chamomile extract and rosemary leaf oil.<br /><br />So far, I'd say this is another quality product from Source Naturals. If it does half of what I hear about it, I'll be happy--but especially if it helps my skin's elasticity and health. The price here with S&S is very, very good and this two-pack is convenient.<br /><br />I want to thank the other reviewer for posting about the eyebrow hair-regrow use. I'm going to start trying it for that (if my facial skin can tolerate it, as I do have a supersensitive face with dermatitis/eczema issues). I also have thinning eyebrows since perimenopause and then menopause hit. They've definitely gotten a bit \\""bald\\"" with age. So, thanks for that tip.<br /><br />Hope this review helps those considering this product...be well...<br /><br />UPDATE: The advice for eyebrows is correct. Mine are filling out in the bald spots. :) Now, I also started taking Biotin with this cream, so it may be synergistic, but I had taken Biotin alone in the past and it alone didn't have the effect on eyebrows this combo does. So, whether it's the both combined or principally the MSM cream, dunno. I use a Q-tip to apply. I have had to pluck a bit more. :D<br /><br />I can't tell yet if it is having any good effect on skin elasticity, but I'm continuing with it. I had to discontinue oral MSM due to an allergic rash reaction, but the cream isn't affecting my sensitive system/skin, so I hope it will have good long-term use effects. I did start using a sage and MSM powder mix on my scalp where my hair is thinning a bit post-menopausally, and I hope that since I can't take it internally, that application pre-shampooing will be efficacious.<br /><br />Hope this helps...ream, so it may be synergistic, but I had taken Biotin alone in the past and it alone didn't have the effect on eyebrows this combo does.

Also, removing the wipes from the container is hassle free and easy to remove, and the lid stays on tight to preserve the wipes from drying out.

Emerald EnergyÂ® Defense: Superior Green Superfood with Premium Hawaiian Spirulina,Health & Personal Care,4,5,5,N,N,Good way to start the day,"I used to start my day with fruit juices like orange and pineapple. They would give me a quick energy burst (probably because of all the sugar), but would eventually wear off, making me feel tired and run-down by mid-morning. A long time ago, I switched to spirulina supplement drinks in the morning. mixed just with water. They do a better job of getting me started and keeping my energy and focus up all morning. Here's a good way to start your day: Mix this up with water and drink. (For a more creamy drink, you might try rice milk, almond milk, or coconut milk instead of water. But that does add a bit of sugar). Since you have to wait about 20 minutes after drinking and before eating, that's a good time for some exercise, like a brisk walk. After about 20 minutes of exercise, then have breakfast. I should add, if you don't like the normal \\""green\\"" taste of most spirulina mixes, you might want to try this one. While each person's taste are a little different, you might find it tastes better than the others.",12/20/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diva Cup Diva Cup #2 Post Childbirth,Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,Y,Easy to use,"I have only used it one month, but already like it more than tampons. I was a little worried at first about getting it out based on some of the other reviews, but really had nothing to worry about. The instructions are very detailed, although the cup is easy to use. Really just place and forget for hours! My heavier days I empty it out about every 6 hours but lighter days I can go as long as needed. I try to think ahead to where I'll be in 12 hours and if it's be easy to empty then. If I know I'll be out and might be in a public restroom, I empty then and know I'll be home in at least 12 hours from that point. It does get a little tricky in public restrooms where you're not right next to a sink, but a cup of water works (although you look a little strange going into the stall with a cup of water). For me I try to empty it at home as much as possible because I still squat down for removal and insertion (maybe others have perfected it in more of a standing position). And squatting is also awkward in a public restroom. Also make sure you have a good grip on the cup when empting, it can get slick and you don't want it falling into dirty water....or maybe always flush before empting.<br />It can be messy when you're emptying it but you wash your hands anyways. I feel much better using this than tampons but I'm the type who has always hated having my period anyway.",8/31/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scivation Xtend Refreshing Blue Raspberry 418-Grams,Health & Personal Care,3,0,0,N,Y,"Pretty Good, but not great","Honestly, I've taken a ton of supplements throughout my bulking and cutting phases in bodybuilding.

Get another flavor if you can, but I doubt it'll help (considering their ingredients).

"Applied Nutriceuticals Igf-2, 240 Caps Bottle",Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,Y,One of the supps that works,"I have just finished up my 2nd course of IGF-2 along with a few other Applied Neutricuticals products (HGH-Up, Neovar) and I've had serious strength gains in the last 3 months. I have also increased my caloric/protein intake though so it is definitely not a one-bottle solution. Take this review as much for an endorsement of the whole App Nut. stack rather than IGF-2 exclusively. As mentioned it's one of the more expensive supplements but I've had good experience with it. Numbers don't mean much because my regimen is going to be completely different from yours, however: Time Taken: 84 days (with app nut stack) Lifting: 4 days week x 90-120m BF Change: 1-3% drop Weight change: + 17 lbs I'm writing this review primarily to report an unexpected benefit. From the very first night I started taking IGF-2, my sleep cycle was better regulated than ever. I've suffered from an irregular sleep cycle all my life, but once I started dosing 3-4 capsules, say about twice a day, the 2nd being right before bed, I found that I wake up every morning at 6-8am regardless of how much sleep I got. If I'm exhausted I often consciously go back to sleep, but it has somehow given me some sort of internal alarm clock. It's quite noticeable because it will go away if I don't take it for a day, and come back immediately when I start again. It's a major game changer and I plan to consult my doctor to find out if it's safe to take this stuff indefinitely. Maybe it has something to do with insulin control?

"Swede-O Deluxe Padded Plantar Fasciitis Night Splint, Colors Vary, Large",Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,Y,Helps with the heel pain,This night split does help with my self-diagnosed plantar fasciitis. When I wear it at night and get out of bed in the morning I don't have the intense heel pain I did before. It's bulky to sleep in but I've gotten used to it. I find that the velcro isn't as strong as it should be and the straps sometimes come undone. I like it more snug so I'm not sure if I pull the straps too tight and that's the cause of the straps coming loose. I often wear it if I'm just sitting around watching TV as well because my foot will tighten up with long periods of rest. There were no directions. It seems self explanatory but it came with a little wedge to put your foot at more of an angle. I couldn't figure out how to get the wedge under the material.

Ivy leaf extract is also added to the Cough Syrup + Mucus Relief version to help thin and loosen mucus. Our stubborn daughter does not resist taking it, so the taste must be pretty good. *Note, that it can NOT be used with children under one year old, since it does contain honey.

Alessi Vinegar Balsamic Red,Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,N,Magic in a bottle,"Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now. My local hyper market sells various brands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost. Honestly have bought some cheap ones but got a glorified bottle of plain vinegar or was un-naturally sweet. Made a pot of my homemade(from scratch)pasta sauce, while it's also been really good 2 tsp of Alessi made it great. Can't believe the taste it gives to a tomatoe based sauce, was eating by the spoonfuls before adding to the pasta. Wanting to experiment some more, I have been wanting to make some roasted red pepper remoulade to jazz up a BLT or Roast Beef sandwhich. This was the key ingredient even more so than the roasted red peppers. The balsamic cut the fatty taste of the mayo(not a fan of may alone except potato/pasta salad)and added an interesting sweetness but not like sugar. Ate couple spoons of that as well. Not to worry I am not a double dipper even in my own house. I think this will wake up a roast beef gravy and who knows what else. Now I know what to buy and can also afford.",8/22/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The armrests are very narrow, which is a problem for a handicapped person who needs to push himself up by leaning on them.<br />The width between the legs is only 21&#34; (not 22.5&#34; as stated) which makes the commode unstable.

Aquasana Shower Filter,Health & Personal Care,2,11,13,N,N,"filters well, but fragile it is","We've had this for almost 3 years now. It seems to do pretty well at filtering out chlorine, judging by smell and how my skin/hair feel. It does make a difference in how both feel. I'd love to see actual measurements of chlorine reduction over time. There's two of us, we take a shower each almost everyday (a bit overkill in my mind, sorry mom) and the filter seems to last 3 to 4 months. But remember there's no quantitative analysis going on here. The whole contraption, with the exception the connections, is plastic. Given the mechanical loads it undergoes it's not surprising that it breaks fairly easily. The housing has fractured on ours with no unusual force being encountered. ( Ahhh epoxy... Wasn't I trying to *reduce* my exposure to something or another? Oops. ) Taking apart a used filter reveals a simple case containing what I assume to be activated charcoal, exactly like you may buy for an aquarium filter with a little bit of paper or synthetic mesh I assume is for sediment. Only thing is that if you did buy this much charcoal from a pet store, it would cost about one tenth what a replacement filter cost. All filters must reduce water flow to some degree. This filter does pretty well here, the reduction is minimal. If you're looking to reduce the odor (at least) of chlorine and don't have kids, and don't mind the steep replacement filter costs, and promise not to ever overtighten anything, nor ever to drop, pull, or stare directly into its eyes then this is the filter for you!! Not awful but not recommended.",7/1/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personal Trainer Foodâ„¢ Weight Loss Meal Program: Lunch & Dinner,Health & Personal Care,2,11,15,N,N,Not Great Quality Meats,"I ordered a package that was on sale here through Amazon Local. I ordered the protein package. I am sorely disappointed. I only am enjoying about one out of five of the meals. Many of the chicken cutlets are not cleaned properly of their tendons and grizzle. The spices and/or additives used might make one feel more full yet it often gives me a headache and when I can't eat it because of an odd taste I find that the family dog doesn't want it either. The package did come quickly, in cellophane packages still very frozen yet it is not an easy item to return. I learned that there is only a five day window in which to complain and for me I was still hopeful and sampling the foods during those first five days. I would not recommend this to anyone I cared about. I would only say that it might be better than starving if you are going through an extremely stressful patch in your life. Otherwise the least expensive frozen diet meal like Lean Cuisine in my opinion would be way better quality and when your supermarket has sales would be way cheaper than the Personal Trainer Food. I am writing this long review since this is one of the first Amazon purchases I ever made where I felt the reviews misled me. I really am more disappointed in this than any other item I ever purchased on Amazon or on line period. I also feel badly that there was little recourse for me-the PTF rep wrote to me basically saying I only had a five day window to voice my concerns and that was it. The only frozen food I ever purchased that was as sub par as this was some frozen prepared meals from Walmart--but Walmart backs up their products and PTF does not after five days.",3/7/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactive Sex Toys BBW Fleshy Light Male Masturbator - 3 Pack,Health & Personal Care,3,1,2,N,Y,Ehhhh,"i kind of regret buying this. I was into the whole wanting to see average sized and chubby women on porn finally, but I didn't know it was gonna be that extreme; the cover is misleading: the majority of the DVDs had EXTREMELY large women, and it made me feel uncomfortable because they werent even that attractive in the face. One of the DVDs had nothing to do with large women, which is fine with me. Just be warned that these are extremely EXTREMELY large women for the most part, although the second halves of the movie have oldER (not old) women and those scenes were pretty good; although they probably just send random DVDs. Aside from that, I'll have to make a review on the masturbator another time, as I got this just for the DVDs. My advice: stick to the ones with PRIME if you have a prime account. The next pack I get will probably be the Latina one, no surprises there. The shipping was pretty good with this one, as it wasn't due for another 5 days. I recommend other DVDs unless you're into 350+ pound women. Take care...",11/6/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suffer from Achilles Tendonitis with a side of Plantar Fasciitis. I like these insoles because they provide the extra arch support I need, and are wide enough in the larger size I buy to work well with my wide feet (my only complaint about the Orthaheels was, while they seem to actually be a better-made product -more sturdy that is- they were too narrow for me and the arch support was in the middle of my foot).<br /><br />They wear out \\""quickly\\"" (depending on your definition), so I have to buy a new pair every 3-4 months.

Just 15 minutes at 55Â°C (132Â°F) will deactivate the enzyme, robbing all its health benefits.

Just really expensive. It is also slightly annoying that sometimes I pull 2 wipes out of the package instead of 1. You have to be careful when pulling one out.

This amino-acid is extremely important for helping to rid the body of free radicals that can cause or aggravate serious disease. It is hard to get into the blood stream via the digestive tract as it is destroyed by hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Absorption through the skin eliminates this issue.<br /><br />Ever since I started using it, I have noted an improvement in mood, memory, and energy. It didn't happen overnight but, after about three weeks, I started noticing a difference. I have been using it on myself for about one and a half months now. I have also noticed that my nails are growing faster and look healthier overall. I plan to use this for some of my more chronically ill autoimmune patients after doing the proper testing to ensure they are good candidates.

Doc Johnson Titanmen Big Stuff Large,Health & Personal Care,5,5,5,N,Y,"very heavy, very good, with a superb gravity-assisted exit","Curved backdoor toys are supposed to add extra sensations on top of what they are otherwise designed for. These can be curved column dongs which provide a better fit for the naturally arched inner cavities. These can be prostate stimulators, most often in the shape of towers or permanent plugs. Finally, all sorts of curved fantasy shapes are possible too. The point in using them is to tickle a specific spot, hence choosing the right tool for personal anatomy is key.<br /><br />Titanmen Big Stuff Large is a a very simple curved dong. The 62 mm bead at the top gives way to two rings followed by a curved column. The dong is quite heavy, and features a massive base with a sucker, allowing for safe riding once the column is all in. It is a superbly made toy, much easier to use than others of similar girth.<br /><br />Build and Entry:<br />------------<br />Big Stuff Large is quite large, but I could easily imagine a 10 mm thicker dong that would be as easy to use. I wish they had made an XL version. The top bead is 62 mm in diameter, although since it's an ellipsoid, it will be as easy to insert as toys which are 3-4 mm smaller in diameter. The two rings that follow are 57 mm in diameter, followed by a shallow 51 mm gap. From that point on, there are no features on the smooth, curved column, that continues to slowly increase in girth, reaching 60 mm in diameter at the base, at 170 mm of insertable length.<br /><br />Even though 62 mm might sound like much, this is by far the easiest toy to insert among my large collection of 60+ mm backdoor toys. Once the top bead is in, there are no difficulties to come -- it simply slides in all the way to the base. It is really quite surprising! If only some of my other toys were as easy on my bum.<br /><br />Capture:<br />------------<br />Since it's pointless to stop at the gap which follows the rings, the sphincter will be always dilated, anywhere from 50 to 60 mm, depending on how deep the toy is in. The best use of Big Stuff is fastriding. It is not a probe, but since it's significantly curved, it will bang just above the prostate, repeatedly, if the insertor chose to sit on this thing all the way down. I have found that prostate stimulation is more effective if the curved dong is only 2/3 of the way in. As such, I prefer to use it standing up.<br /><br />Exit:<br />------------<br />Now for the fun part. Although it is really easy to extract by hand, I now do it hands-free, standing up. Just letting go of the column will let gravity do its work. Since it's so heavy, it will begin sliding out on its own, accelerating in the process. There will be a slowdown when the bead hits the sphincter from within, and a gasp-inducing plonk will eject the bead also, and the heavy dong falling onto the floor. I can't imagine using this toy and not trying a gravity assisted exit ;)",5/25/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Organic Stevia Extract Powder No Fillers 1lb(448g),Health & Personal Care,5,7,8,N,Y,BEST PRICE around on any stevia extract powder around. GREAT QUALITY!,"I bought this stevia for the first time, a few months ago. I've been using stevia extract powder (1/32 tsp. = tsp. sugar) for almost 10 years and this brand is just as good as the other brands and the cheapest price I've seen around per serving. This is such a great deal compared to the other brands of stevia I've purchased in the past. A pound (16 ounces) of stevia extract powder for $40 is such a great deal. The Now brand sells for $55-60 a lb. and around 7-8 years ago I paid more than that for that size bottle at a local health food store and it lasted me more than a year (I was only able to buy it once from that store like that. They no longer sell the big bottle like that. They use the bottle to repackage in smaller zipper baggies and sell by the ounce. They were surprised I wanted to buy the big bottle which they did have a price on.) The last few years, I was purchasing a 3.5 ounce bottle of the Kal brand for $28-30 at another local health food store and that much wouldn't last me 2-3 months. I use a lot of stevia, mostly for my cold green tea with lemon, which I drink like water, from 1 to 1 1/2 liters of tea a day. Also, I refill an old small (1 oz.?) Now bottle of stevia, and carry it around in my purse for sweetening unsweet tea in restaurants, which I use about once or twice a week. I also use stevia to sweeten coffee, which I had only been drinking once or twice a week but lately I have been drinking coffee more often. As far as the taste and sweetness, it's just as good as the other brands like Now and Kal. It's just as good as the store brand that I bought for several years from Vitamin World, which they used to sell a few yrs ago (which they don't anymore, they use a more \\""watered down\\"" stevia powder now). The Kal brand is slightly sweeter but a lot of times I was easily using too much of that brand anyway. If I was using 4-5 scoops of Kal brand to sweeten a large glass of tea in a restaurant, I may need to add an extra scoop or two of this brandto get it just as sweet but this brand is still such a great deal and I'm less likely to use too much. It's been awhile since I've used the Now brand but far as I can remember it's similiar to Kal brand but Kal may be slightly sweeter. Again, this is the best deal around on stevia. The best price and just as good as other brands. I still have a lot left and will definitely purchase this brand again. It may be a year before I need some more but this brand is dated 1 1/2 yrs from now (which I've already had half a year). I'm sure it would still be good long after the sell by date but I'll have it used up long before the date. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this stevia.",1/23/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herbal Actives Red Yeast Rice Extended Release - 120 Mini-tabs,Health & Personal Care,5,1,1,N,Y,THE BEST if you want to get rid of Cholesterol pills,"this product i bought was recommended from one of my Dr. friends. he said all the cholesterol pills leads to major side effects including zahaymer disease, it kills the brain cells. so he said use these pills while using your cholesterol pills as every other day. so i made my mom consume 2 pills of this each 3 days before bed and the 4th day is her cholesterol pill, after a month period checkup, her cholesterol was perfect, she continued but this time each 4 days of this pills she takes her cholesterol pill and the readings was an extreme perfect. this pills works very well and as prescribed it's natural. i recommend anyone who has cholesterol to use it BUT:<br />1- FIRST, ask your doctor about your new plan.<br />2- have a blood test before consuming these pills (including cholesterol)<br />3- NEVER leave you cholesterol pills, just accompany both as u work your way up till you stop the cholesterol pills.<br />4- NEVER rush it, u've been living with cholesterol pills for how many years!!! so take it easy and work your way up month by month till you reach it.<br />one last hint, the Dr. told me to give my mom the CoQ10 pills every morning because the cholesterol pills accelerates ageing, so it increases wrinkles.

Peeper Keepers Eyeglass Retainer | Supercord | w/Bonus,Health & Personal Care,5,0,1,N,Y,A Comfortable Way To Keep Glasses In Place,"I have a nasty habit of falling asleep with my glasses on, and other times they simply slide off my nose. Either way they wind up on the floor or under me - neither of which is good for the glass frame. The Peeper Keepers keep the glasses from falling any farther than my chest, and neither can they swing underneath me. Glass frame saved. From other reviews I've read, the ability of the retainer strap to stay on the glasses is an issue. These do not suffer from that problem. They stay in place wherever you put them; yes, sliding them in place takes a little bit of effort, but they don't move either. And the material they're made from is comfortable enough against the skin. A good, basic product that is well made and works as intended; at Amazon's price for a three pack, its a bargain as well.",1/26/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ziploc Vacuum Starter Kit, 3-Quart Bags",Health & Personal Care,4,113,119,N,N,Good to have around for the price...,"[[VIDEOID:mo2Z765I8AEXTOX]]I have the Reynolds vac sealer that I bought over a year ago as well. That works just as well, however they no longer sell it in my area, to my knowledge anyawy,so when I saw this pump I was curious. First of all, you can't beat the price. The refill bags are reasonably priced as well. I purchased them at a Walmart in my area. The pump and the battery powered Reynolds sealer are comparable to each other in function. I have used the pump many times and have had one instance where there seemed to be some air leakage; to remedy the problem, I re-pumped and placed 2 strips of tape over the pump entry point- so far so good. The way I see it, even if it doesn't work 100% all the time, it still gets more air out than using an ordinary zip seal bag alone, and at such a cheap price, I feel it more than pays for itself.<br /><br />In the video, I demo both the Reynolds and the Ziploc so you can see how they match up to eachother. Also, you'll notice that the Ziploc bags can be used with the Reynolds sealer ,which is good to know if the Reynolds bags are no longer available in your area, and you own one too.",2/14/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's simple to use (just apply to clean, dry toenails by rubbing the applicator tip over the nail, around the cuticle, and along the open edge of the nail once a day, at bedtime), and there's no staining of socks, sheets, or other fabrics. No strange odors, no weird sensations, nothing. Just let it dry for a few minutes before putting socks on, if you're going to put them on after applying the treatment.",6/12/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many sleep aids are loaded with unidentifiable drugs, but Active Rest's simple and wholesome formula assures me that I know what I'm putting in my body. Now, after several weeks of using the product, I have seen first hand the benefits of taking Active Rest before going to sleep each night.

MDHearingAid Acoustitone PRO Hearing Aid (Set of 2),Health & Personal Care,5,2,2,N,Y,Be careful when cutting the tube & I have questions!!,"This is a review and two questions. My review: The manual says to be careful when I cut the tube to fit around the ear. Well...I cut a little too much, and so the tube is too short now. I called the company and explained the situation. The tube kit, which also includes dome-shaped plug, is $25.90 for pair. plus $3.95 S&H. So, be careful when you cut the tube because they don't sell just the tube. The customer service also said that they sell a thin tube kit, which they say is more invisible, for $34.90. plus $3.95 S&H. I guess this is a must because, although I was impressed with how well it worked, I was a bit disappointed with the size, and how visible it was. My questions: How do I make sure that tubes don't fall off. When I pull out the plug, the tube often gets disconnected. Is it ok to glue it? That is, I carefully use crazy glue so i don't clog the tube. Another question is about the setting. H is for those who have sloping hearing loss. But what if I have a little bit of both? I set my volume to about 1 and 1/3 under N. it gets too loud if i set it to 2. So, i guess my hearing loss isn't that bad. but it gets worse when there are distractions like in outside. Are there many people who switch from N (low pitch) to H (High Pitch, distraction) when they go out in a crowd? And then, back to N when they come indoor?",9/29/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honeywell C7189R1004 Wireless Air Indoor Sensor,Home Improvement,2,1,2,N,Y,Updated review: Sometimes setup is troublesome,"I ordered 4 of these for 2 thermostats, and the setup and install for the first two was a breeze. There are some limitations as to how the thermostat will use the thermostats temperature, but thats really a problem with the thermostat, not this product. However, for the other two I had problems. During setup, the unit kept giving me an orange light, when the manual only mentions either a green or red light. Even if I assumed that the orange light was supposed to mean &#34;red,&#34; that didn't make sense. Red indicates a dead battery, and I used several fresh sets of batteries. I never could get one unit to install. I contacted Honeywell support, and since this is supposed to be a contractor installed item, they will not help. If you do purchase this item, make sure you install it immediately. That way if it doesn't work, you can just return without having to deal with honeywell support. There are reports that these units might work initially, but fail/stop connecting to thermostat in a year or so, so that is still a concern you must deal with.",7/13/2015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I might also pick up another 4 pack and try using these for my spring vegetable grow starts (just to see if they work since they seem as bright as the 6400K florescents).<br /><br />One thing I will caution you of is to make sure you have current tombstones that are non-shunted (tombstones are the end mounts in florescents).

Like the other reviewer I don't get all the negative comments here. I had my handyman put this on my silvered, wearing badly deck with full, west/south sun exposure in SC 7years ago. He properly cleaned and prepped the deck and had recommended this noting the cost was worth it.<br /><br />It not only turned the silvered, rough boards a lovely pale cedar color (1/2 natural + 1/2 cedar mix). It also lasted until this to year when my deck had gotten very dirty and algae'd with the SC moisture and humidity. Just got the deck power washed this week to get all dirt and grime off. It's clean now and really surprisingly the deck boards are back to the nice cedar color! Amazing as I did literally no maintenance in 7 years.<br /><br />I'm now buying a couple more gallons to refresh it and re-seal again and expect another 7 years. Worth every penny just not to have to resell/stain deck every 2 years like I did in my prior home when I used Behring or Thompson stain and seals.

"LE 16.4ft LED Flexible Strip Lights, 300 Units SMD 3528 LEDs, 12V DC Non-waterproof, Light Strips, LED ribbon, For Garden/Home/Kitchen/Car/Bar, DIY Party Decoration Lighting",Home Improvement,3,12,15,N,Y,This about sums up what you're to expect from these LEDs....,"These LED strips have their ups and downs.<br /><br />It seems this is a common problem I've seen when buying these strips. The first 12v power cable interface is solid but the 2nd one (that's included in the package) seems to be either broken or on the point of breaking. Not to mention that i got my packages somewhat damaged which didn't affect the LEDs but could have caused damage with the power cables.<br /><br />Remember this: These are &#34;sticky&#34; strips and, if you don't go over them and keep pressing them down (the first few days) they may actually come loose. And whatever you do, make sure there is NO stress where the cable is connected or it will pull loose. An alternative might be &#34;stapling&#34; them into place where the power cables are attached to ensure they will not come off whatever surface they are attached to.<br /><br />How these units respond to very hot weather....I'm not there yet but they don't seem to lose their adhesiveness during cold weather. I'm in Alabama so summers don't get much more hot/humid here so i will update this in a few months.Still, as an alternative lighting source, i have to admit...these aren't bad.<br /><br />I would guess that if someone could develop a USB connector with a wireless switching system (or just toggle switches) this could make any RV, or possibly even a man-cave look really nice.. It's all about the direction they are being used and the angles. Also, having them project onto a &#34;white&#34; back surface has a much nicer effect.<br /><br />Oh, you might want to limit their burn period to a maximum of 16 hours, those 12v adapter get pretty HOT when the LEDs have been used for a long period of time.<br /><br />And, by the way, do NOT try to run 2 strips on one 12v adapter...you will probably get a burnout in 12-18 hours. Already made that mistake in hopes of getting two for one...won't work.<br /><br />I know people are planning on using these in cars but you had better make sure they are secure because, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it. Tough is something these LEDs are not meant to be.ause, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it.

Frost King SP57/67 R6.7 SP56/67 Water Heater Insulation Blanket,Home Improvement,1,2,3,N,N,Total junk - didn't fit a standard 50 gallon tank,"As many others reported, this blanket, which claims it will fit around a 50 gallon tank, doesn't wrap completely around it. The tank is in a newer townhouse I bought, which I plan to move to after other work is completed inside. So, I looked it up on Amazon and as others stated, it doesn't fit many tanks and there isn't enough tape to completely seal the seam either. What's the point of not enclosing enough tape to seal the seam? Just so we have to buy a roll of some sort of tape to finish the job?<br /><br />I measured the circumference of the tank before buying a blanket for it, so I thought I had the correct product. How can this company claim it fits around one when it doesn't? So I measured the width of the blanket, and yes, it's the size stated, so not sure why it doesn't fit the tank. Luckily, I bought this at a local hardware store, to which I returned it, with no hassle, but the store didn't have anything else in stock, so I left without a water heater blanket. I then tried both HDs and the Lowe's stores in my city, but the only ones they had were the same thing, or nothing on the shelves. I guess they had sold out.<br /><br />Upon doing extensive research now, I've decided that a fiberglass blanket that's so thin, isn't going to be enough added insulation to make my water heater much more efficient (trying to reduce stand-by loss). So I'm looking for a thick mineral wool blanket instead. Mineral wool is both waterproof and more fireproof than this piece of junk.<br /><br />Remember to insulate your water pipes as much as possible too.

Lava Lite Grande 250-Ounce 27-Inch Lava Lamp,Home Improvement,5,3,3,N,Y,Get ready to pull out your old records...,"It's funny how you end up doing some of the things you do...this is a perfect example. I had been given a couple of smaller Lava Lites left over from a TV commercial, and as a goof we put one on top of a subwoofer in our home theater off to the side of the screen. My wife and I would catch ourselves staring over at it on commercials or during bad TV episodes or films. So when I found out there was a BIG A** version of it I just had to one-click it on Amazon.<br /><br />We have had a BALL with this thing-literally! We got the yellow and purple based on other reviews-It does have an excellent contrast of the colors, though I think it's kind of a drag not to be able to buy additional colored bottles once you have the base unit. Did I mention it is BIG?? NOT 250 ounces like the ad (That's almost 2 Gallons!)- The bottle is actually 57 ounces, so about the size of a two-liter bottle- a little wider on the bottom and and around 4\\"" taller because of the cone effect of the lamp shape. Patience is a virtue here; it does take over two hours to heat up to the point where it's dripping red ball shapes. Up until that time the wildest Formaldehyde Baby, hydrogen bomb cloud, Area 51 alien, and cellulite fat looking shapes ever imagined form at all levels of the lamp-which is cool on its own! And the amount of activity once it's fully warmed up is awesome as well- it's so big inside that seeing 6, 10, or more balls dripping while large ghost shapes are behind is common. As other reviews have said, make sure you center the lamp-another advantage is with this size one being so tall the actual bulb for the lamp is far enough off the base that you don't need to worry as much about heat damaging veneers underneath. We keep it on a black Paridigm sub for six hours with no signs of damage, but you're on your own here for your use. And the sub if if anything seems to help the experience. And we heeded the advise of another good reviewer and we do limit the total time to six hours, not the eight the one-sheet that comes with it says.<br /><br />Over a month now, and running 2-3 days a week, it's been fantastic. This is a blatant trick by Amazon to make me go buy SACD's of Dark Side of the Moon, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and a few other classic 70's LP's... and it WORKED! A great talking point, stress reliever, and reason to get slightly altered and turn up the volume. Highly Recommended!",7/20/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The standard red, blue, and green seem to be the best. Multiple settings for fading between colors is nice. The only downside is that the regular white setting is not the best if you want it to replace a standard Incandescent or CFL. However the main focus of this bulb seems to be color, and not meant to replace a standard white light. Other than that, it works great and I have no complaints.

Suncourt Flush Fit Register Air Booster Fan and Flush Fit Mount Adaptor,Home Improvement,4,37,41,N,Y,"Works well, with modifications","I have a wall heater vent that is about 40 feet from the furnace. The contractor that put in the bedroom addition decided to connect the duct to the end of a duct that already feeds two other rooms. In the past, I had to close the other two vents in order to feel any appreciable flow out of the end vent, and still the room was much colder than the rest of the house.<br /><br />Although this model is described as white in color, the booster that I received is closer in color to the gray outlet- and switch plates. As others have mentioned, it is somewhat loud, and removing the inner grates helped to some extent. On closer inspection, I found that one of the fans would not spin freely. I discovered that both fans were not assembled correctly. Specifically, the fan bearings were not pressed fully into the hub. When I looked at the gap between the fan (the rotating part) and the frame, I could see the coils of copper wire inside. Supporting the hub, I pressed each fan down until it seated fully. The blades sit much closer to the hub support arms. I noticed that both fans spin much more freely and the booster is noticeably quieter.<br /><br />The fans are model DFC902512M by coolingfan.cn, 12VDC, 0.20A. This model is not listed on their website, but a similar 92x92x25mm, 12VDC, 0.20A model listed has the following specifications: voltage: 6-13.8VDC, speed: 2500rpm, airflow: 48.1cfm, pressure: 2.60mmH2O, noise: 31dBa, weight: 77g. Tach measurements give the following fan speeds: low: 2000rpm, medium: 2200rpm, high: 2500rpm. At medium speed, the noise level seems comparable to that of the unboosted vents closer to my furnace. There is a more significant jump in speed and noise from medium to high than low to medium. I use medium.<br /><br />While the unit was open, I also desoldered the thermistor from the control board and extended it with a pair of wires by about 8 inches out the back. I was able to thread the two thin wires through the original hole for the thermistor and out of one of the rectangular access holes for the fan catches without the need for drilling an additional hole. The thermistor now sits deeper inside the duct. The unit no longer cycles on and off repeatedly at the start and end of the heater cycle due to the fan blowing directly on the thermistor. There is no hysteresis programmed into the controller, so the fans cycle on and off at exactly the set temperature.<br /><br />The LEDs for the indicator panel fit into tubular guides. You can inserted a small wad of cotton or tissue into each tube to dampen the amount of light emitted, and not alter the external appearance of the booster.<br /><br />The booster comes with a 12VDC, 500ma transformer-type wall wart. According to my Kill-a-Watt meter, it is drawing 1W at idle, 5W on low, 6W on medium, and 7W on high. Note that the fans are rated 2.4W each according to the labels, 4.8W together. When power is reset, the booster seems to remember the last-used settings.<br /><br />This booster fits best if the duct opening is flat and square. In my case, the metal duct extends slightly from the drywall and the spackling is uneven. Due to this protrusion and the design of the plastic faceplate and adapter, the unit does not sit flush against the surrounding drywall. I will have to either trim the duct and spackling flush with the drywall, or adhere a strip of thin foam insulation around the perimeter of the back of the faceplate to close this irregular gap.<br /><br />The room is warmer and comfortable with the booster installed and running. Considering the quality of parts and type of materials used, I do wish it was a little less expensive. I also had to order the adapter plate for larger vents, plus a 120VAC flat-plug extension cord so that it can be plugged into a wall outlet behind furniture. However, it is relatively simple device that can be completely disassembled and is servicable to the circuit board level with readily-available parts.",1/27/2015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Nordic Pure 20x20x2M13-3 20x20x2 MERV 13 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filter, Box of 3, 2-Inch",Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,Y,"Does the job, fits perfectly.","It's always somewhat surprising to pull out an old furnace filter and see how much dust it has collected over a few months. My particular system uses a 2&#34; x 20&#34; x 20&#34; filter -- a size that is not readily available from the &#34;big box&#34; home centers. This proved to be a blessing in disguise, as it caused me to research what &#34;MERV&#34; meant -- and I discovered that the filters carried by local vendors were of rather low quality in the level of filtration. As an allergy sufferer, I was pleased to be able to purchase a higher level of filtration that should reduce the allergens moving though my home's air handling system. These filters appear to fulfill my needs very well and were quite reasonably priced.<br /><br />In my home, the furnace is in the attic, and the filter is positioned just behind a grill in the ceiling of a central hall. The measurements of filters tend to be slightly less than the nominal measurement, which made installation a 'three hand' situation. (Solved by turning on the system fan, allowing the air flow to hold the filter in place while closing the grill that holds the filter in place.) The filter does not firmly contact the sides of the filter box, but the duct behind the filter is slightly smaller, so that in operation, the air pressure holds the filter against the duct giving an adequate seal.<br /><br />The filter appears to be sturdy and should preform its task without structure failure.",6/18/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

MK Diamond 156426 Portable Mobility Stand,Home Improvement,3,7,7,N,N,A &quot;gotta-have&quot; for the MK-101Pro,"This cart is a must have if you own the 110lb MK-101Pro or similar saw. It makes transporting much easier. Previously I had to dissassemble the saw into two pieces plus the stand and carry each piece to or from the trailer for transport.<br />There is some pretty good engineering with the ATS stand but it could have been designed better, especially for the price. The legs are held in place by 1/4&quot; bolts which I doubt will last long because of the extreme stress placed on them when raising and lowering the saw. The instructions that came with the stand showing the purchaser how to attach the saw are all but useless. The pictures are pitiful. It took me almost an hour to figure out things that with proper instruction would have taken minutes.<br />The pneumatic tires are secured only with an axle cap. The tire wabbles. It would not surprise me if this method of attachment doesn't fail quickly.<br />Other parts are the saw stand show thought and engineering. The way the legs fold out of the way is good. A stand on the end of the saw, which allows it to be placed on end ready for wheeling to or from the job site, can be removed after raising the stand into its working position and placed in slots on the side of the stand for an additional working surface. I really like that feature. With the saw attached the unit is well balanced for transporting like a handtruck.",8/12/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GE WR57X10051 Ice Maker Double Solenoid Water Valve,Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,Y,Works Great,It was suppose to be a direct replacement for my 22 year old GE Refrigerator but is was not. The supply line on my old valve was a flare type and this valve required a compression type. Not really a problem I just cut off the flared end on my copper supply line and purchased compression fitting and furrel. I believe the newer refrigerators have plastic supply lines that use a compression type connection so this should not be a problem for newer refrigerators. Also the solenoid terminals were smaller and required an 2 adapters and there was only one in the package. I saved lot on money by doing it myself so overall I happy with this purchase.,9/13/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bosch 1600PS LP Aquastar 4.7 GPM Indoor Solar Whole-House Tankless Liquid Propane Water Heater,Home Improvement,4,8,8,N,N,Good Back up,"I have a 'batch' solar hot water tank on my roof I put in when I built the house in 1990. It preheats the water before it goes into a water heater, and previously I had an LP gas heater, a 40 gallon tank. That system worked well, but four years ago I did an addition and put in a Bosch solar type tankless heater designed to back up the solar hot water. It works very well, sensing the temperature of the water coming from the roof and firing up only as needed to increase the temperature if the water from the batch heater isn't hot enough. While it works perfectly there are two concerns. One is that the solar unit has a standing pilot light rather than electronic ignition; I believe they could figure out how to fix this. Secondly, the unit is small and if someone upstairs calls for hot water while I am in the shower the water gets cold until I adjust the mix, then the water is hot enough. This heater will not work for a large family, though putting in two might work. It has saved a lot of money in LP gas, and I have noticed the reduction since putting in the Bosch compared to the previous method. I can't say how much because I used to use LP gas to cook and when I did the addition we switched to an electric stove, so the gas use would have been reduced anyway. Still, I use very little LP gas on a yearly basis, only 200-300 gallons for home heating and water heating for a 2700 sq. ft. house; not bad!",2/2/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But for larger elements like helmets, I have to print them in multiple pieces and glue them together.<br /><br />Anyway, one day I ran out of glue mid-project. I bought some of this brand at a local store, tried it, and it worked better than any super glue I had used before. I returned to the store, bought them out, and ordered a bunch more here on Amazon.<br /><br />Now, so you get the best mileage out of it, some information on cyanoacrylate glue:<br />How cyanoacrylate glue does *not* work:<br />* &#34;Drying.&#34;<br />* Melting the plastic on the two sides together.<br />* Evaporating.<br />* Pretty well any other method of bonding you've ever heard about for it.<br /><br />How cyanoacrylate glue *does* work:<br />* In the presence of water, liquid super glue polymerizes. In other words, the individual molecules of super glue plastic which make up the liquid form bond to each other in long chains and turn into a solid plastic. This solid plastic is what holds the two sides together.<br />* Blowing on a cyanoacrylate glue works because the moisture in your breath kicks off the polymerizing/solidifying. Touching it with your skin also works due to the moisture in your skin, but this is a very bad idea since cyanoacrylate glue has no problems bonding to skin.<br />* Spraying cyanoacrylate glue with water also very quickly kicks off solidifying, but you may not get as good of a joint as if you let it dry a bit slower.<br />* Because you're literally filling the crack with a different type of plastic, ideally you want to use as thin of a layer as you can get away with. You want to use the strength of the surrounding plastic, not try to add strength using a weaker filler plastic meant solely for bonding.<br />* As with any cyanoacrylate glue, keep the fumes out of your eyes. They hurt. I speak from experience many times over.<br /><br />This stuff is quick drying and very strong. It holds together ABS very well. It also seems to hold PLA together pretty well, though I have less experience on that front than with ABS. But it's the best super glue I've tried.try to add strength using a weaker filler plastic meant solely for bonding.<br />* As with any cyanoacrylate glue, keep the fumes out of your eyes. They hurt.

Spray Clean Water Saving High Performance Shower Head 2.0 Gpm,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,Y,More than you pay for,"I chose this because I sorted the customer reviews and this came out rated the highest for low flow shower heads. I could not believe a $5.00 shower head would come out on top, but took a shot and got it. I just installed it, so I can't speak to it's durability, but it feels solid and I suspect it will last. The instillation was a snap (they even include Teflon tape!) But you will need and adjustable pliers to get it tight enough so it doesn't leak, at least I did. The water flow and pressure are the best I have experienced from any low flow; strong, steady, even, and full. It swivels without leaking a drop.

Detachable High Pressure Handheld Shower Head - With Water Saving Ionic Filtration Showerhead for Dry Skin and Hair,Home Improvement,2,0,0,N,Y,Seemed promising but unimpressed by the end.,"I used this shower head for just over a month hoping to see a difference in my complexion and hair because the water at my apartment is pretty harsh. I saw no effects whatsoever during that month which was unfortunate. I was pretty impressed with the amount of pressure this head puts out. Though the pressure was good, it also created a sort of wind tunnel that caused my shower curtain to invade my bubble and fondle me while showering. Not pleasant. Certainly better suited for a shower or tub with a glass door. I just mentioned that the pressure was great but I must note that the pressure got increasingly strong as time passed. By the end of the month it was borderline painful which was ultimately the reason for swapping it out for something else.",8/11/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GE GeoSpring Hybrid Water Heater GEH50DNSRSA,Home Improvement,2,1,1,N,N,Better hope it doesn't break down!,"Purchased this unit about 4 1/2 years ago. Very please with it until just recently. Stopped running in the heat pump mode. VERY hard to find anyone to work on it. Called GE and finally was able to make an appt with a service company. The repairman arrived, expecting us to already have the part for him. GE told us HE would be bringing the part. He spent over an hour and a half trying to figure out exactly what was wrong with it, all the while on the phone with either his company tech or GE tech. So, he eventually left and had us order the part from GE. Part arrived. Called to make another appt for service. Called the day of the appt (to find out if it would be morning or afternoon when the service guy would arrive)....and was told they had no record of appt. THEN they proceeded to tell us that we were to get the part from THEM....WHY had we ordered it from GE??? AUHHHH. Made ANOTHER appt for the next day. Service guy arrives, installs the parts that GE sent us (2 fans)...still wouldnt work. After an hour on the phone with GE, they decided that the &#34;board&#34; was the problem. Now that is ordered and we are waiting for it to arrive, then there will be ANOTHER service call appt. Have NO IDEA how much this is going to cost us. Yes, GE covers the part in the 10 yr warranty, but not the labor. THREE SERVICE CALLS!!!",7/11/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Delta RP50813 Palo Soap / Lotion dispenser,",Home Improvement,4,4,6,N,Y,Leave it to Amazon; they HAD THIS IN STOCK!,"We just remodeled the kitchen (Okay, we are in process... everything that was in the kitchen is now in the living room)<br /><br />The Delta Faucet we bought is fantastic, and this little gem matches the single dispenser that came with the Faucet. (Somebody explain why Delta doesn't put dispensers in for BOTH HOLES!<br /><br />Pumping action is everything you'd want it to be. It's quick to prime the pump, and it pumps quantity in accordance with your hand pressure.<br /><br />The bottle that holds the liquid has adequate room, but considering the difficulty involved in putting high quality dish soap and hand lotion into these bottles, they would have done well to have offered a tube that plugs into a large bottle on the floor under the sink. Short of that, it would be valuable to have received a funnel. The dispensers can be filled without removing the bottles. I don't recommend it if what you're adding is thick. It won't go in through the top. I removed the bottles and tried a funnel and was able to encourage my hand lotion to slide through the funnel neck into the bottle, by poking the dispenser &#34;straw&#34; through the funnel and into the bottle... many times. I'd not want to have to fill this very often. I made a mess, but now have very clean, very soft hands!<br /><br />I'll solve this problem of filling the bottles and get back to you!

"Keeney K835-9 High Performance Adjustable FlushAll Toilet Tank Flush Valve, 3 in. to 2 in.",Home Improvement,2,5,6,N,N,"a little too big and too thick, but it works; bad chain","First of all, it is a tall flush valve: the overflow tube adjusts from 8.5\\"" to 13\\"" and is by .5 \\"" taller than the OEM. I thought my Eljer Emblem toilet was standard height (it is 9.25\\"" tall to the front rim or the flush lever hole), but the valve barely fit, given that the fill valve's critical level should be higher by 1 inch than the top edge of the overflow tube. All the parts seem larger now a days, which does not mean better. A Plumb Craft fill valve I got adjusts from 9\\"" to 14\\"" but even when critical level line is just 1/4\\"" above the flush valve, the total height makes the lid not to fit. You may want to consider getting a pressure actuated fill valve (no float no rod) or measure your toilet carefully.<br /><br />The main idea behind this patented performance enhancing valve is the funneling effect created by a wider mouth, where the flapper sits and a narrower opening at the bottom of the valve. The flapper is really wide, so make sure you insert the bolts prior to attaching the flush valve or you may have problems with getting them through the holes.<br /><br />I could not position the flush valve perpendicularly to the tank walls, I rotated it a bit counterclockwise, because the flapper was brushing against the front wall. This would be OK, if it worked smoothly afterwards, but then the chain was catching the flapper, by hanging behind it and holding it up vertically in the air with water running forever, unless I wait and release the flush lever again. If I wanted to rotate the valve the other way, I'd have to disassemble everything and start over. So, I replaced the chain first, since it was really poor quality. This did not help, the smaller gauge chain still held the flapper up until I lowered the water fill level. If this water level proves sufficient, it will save us even more water, though the water saving claims are suspicious even after realizing that the valve leaves 1 inch of water at the bottom of the tank when drained (the seat disc is positioned higher than in the previous valve). So make sure to rotate the flapper clockwise towards the fill valve, not away from it. In my opinion instructions should include this advice.<br /><br />The tank to bowl gasket is very thick and it did not work for my Eljer (I was warned about it) - the tank wiggled so much with the bolts fully tightened, I had to get a more stable one (designed specifically for Eljer toilets, with bolts' gaskets and 4 tank rubber \\""feet\\"" incorporated), which included its own bolts. Also, there are just two tank to bowl bolts included even though the pictures on the package shows three. Not that I need them, but it is false advertizing. However, I liked the bolts from this kit better because they have larger heads and wing nuts rather than standard hexagonal nuts. Extra rubber washers proved helpful, too (why would I ever put metal washers or nuts directly against ceramics?).<br /><br />It flushes just fine now, we will see how it holds up in time. I did not buy it for performance improvement - my tank leaked at a tank to bowl bolt.<br /><br />The manufacturer's web site claims that this valve can improve performance OR reduce water usage. The flapper's cone has an internal rotating slot, which will reduce water usage the most when positioned in front and improve performance the most when turned all the way back.<br /><br />By the way, it took me a while to learn that a standard 2 inch flush valve's diameter is not an exact measurement and may actually be as large as 2 1/4 inch (the gasket fills in the space) and all the toilets built prior to 1994 complied with this standard.ed higher than in the previous valve). So make sure to rotate the flapper clockwise towards the fill valve, not away from it.

Eddy Water Descaler Electronic Water Softener,Home Improvement,4,372,380,N,N,"6 months after installation.... not perfectly scale free, but much improved.","There seems to be much confusion as to what this product is supposed to do. So I will start with what the manufacturer says it will not do and I did not expect it to.... It does not remove anything from your water. If you will have your water tested for hardness before and after, if there is any difference, it is not because of the Eddy Electronic Water Descaler. This product does not make your water feel any different or soap lather better.<br /><br />What it does do is prevent the minerals in your water from adhering to the inside of your plumbing, things like shower heads, faucet aerators, clothes washer, dishwasher, inside of your water heater, etc. The minerals are supposed to simply pass through the system and down the drain.<br /><br />SIX WEEKS ago I installed a new water heater to service my 5 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath home. At that time I also disassembled and cleaned the mineral crust from every shower head, faucet aerator, kitchen sink sprayer, etc. I installed the Eddy Electronic Water Descaler the same day the new water heater went in. The Eddy was installed in a location that protects everything in the house, hot and cold side. In the past, when I descaled all that I described above, within 4 weeks I was seeing evidence of scale build up again. (Note: I have city water that is reasonably good quality, but still some mineral content) After six weeks with the Eddy, I see nothing yet. I won't call this a definitive test until I get to 5 or 6 months out with the same result.... but so far so good. I'll update this review at six months.<br /><br />SIX MONTHS out now... I am starting to see a need to clean shower heads and the kitchen sink sprayer. So, I have come to the conclusion that under my conditions of city water, with light mineralization, two people using water here, the Eddy reduces the need to clean scale from faucets and sprayers from every 30 days to about 6 months. An additional benefit is that cleaning is easier than it was before... the scale that is there now is not as firmly attached.<br /><br />This is my last update on this product.is there now is not as firmly attached.<br /><br />This is my last update on this product.",7/1/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Beams MB 980 Battery-Operated Indoor/Outdoor Motion-Sensing LED Ceiling Light,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,Y,Works great in our pantry!,"Love this light, just wish the batteries lasted a little longer. I converted our old pantry with bi-fold doors to a walk in pantry and we needed light. Instead of tearing into the walls and running electrical (which I could do myself), I decided to give this a try. Works great! As soon as we open the door the light comes on and is more than enough light for the pantry. It works day or night without fail and turns off in a respectable amount of time. There are times it turns off before I would like it to, but then I just move and it turns back on right away. My only quibble is I wish the batteries lasted a little longer. I figured being LED they would last a little longer...but then again if it were a regular incandescent I'd probably be changing batteries weekly and the light output would be abysmal. For our need this is a 5 star product.",10/15/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schlage A53TUL625 Polished Chrome A-Series Tulip Keyed Entrance Door Knob Set A53PD-TUL,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,N,homeowner,"I put three of these locks in thirty years ago and never had one problem, and they got used a great deal. I recently changed three entry doors and tried Schlage residential secure key and regular lever locks. I did not know this lock I installed 30 years ago was a light commercial lock, but I can sure tell now. These new Schlage lever locks are junk compared to my old A53PD TUL. The new lock when you open it with the key outside has to be relocked when you come in or with the key. The original lock had a button on the inside that stayed in even if you unlocked it on the outside, so you didn't have to lock it every time you came in. If you manually turned the button on the inside and let it pop out, then it would stay open one both sides but once you push it back, it stayed open on the inside but always locked on the outside. You can also tell the quality of both locks, and the residential feels like it could be ripped off with your hand but not the old lock.",1/19/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genie GER-2 Garage Door Opener Universal Emergency Release Kit,Home Improvement,4,0,1,N,Y,Works as expected,"Installation was easy and I tested that it works properly. The lock is on the cheap side. One tip: make absolutely certain that you install it such that the teeth of the keys face up when you insert the key into the lock. Otherwise, the key may not be able to turn in the lock because gravity is going against the springs inside. At least, that was my experience. Once I installed it with the correct side up, I tested it to work a bunch of times with no problems.<br /><br />Edit: okay, now I realize the actual problem with the lock not turning. The instructions tell you to cut down the bolts that attach the lock to the door, but they don't tell you why. The reason is that when the cylinder on the lock turns, it also causes the steel cable to rotate. If the bolts are long enough, they block the cable from rotating, which blocks the cylinder from rotating. So it is important to cut them short or rig up some other solution to that problem. I used a Dremel cut off wheel.",1/22/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little Giant Ultra Step 300-Pound Duty Rating Fiberglass Ladder,Home Improvement,5,7,7,N,Y,Step Right Up to the Next Level,"A well built gadget ladder that works in a variety of situations like unlevel surfaces or stairwells. It is the best ladder I've ever owned. Here's a couple of bits of information that might be helpful: 1. When fully extended, the highest rung/step rated safe to stand on is 69 inches above the level ground surface. It is the second rung from the top. So, this 8-foot ladder offers a maximum safe standing height of 5 feet 9 inches. 2. The next step up - or the first rung from the top - is labled with \\""Danger\\"" and \\""Warning\\"" stickers. \\""This is not a step.\\"" Well, it is built just like the other rungs and is solid. Therefore, it is a step, if you have uncanny balance and want it to be a step. It is 80 inches above level surface, but I wouldn't want to stand on it without something sturdy to hold on to. Another thing that makes life easier with this ladder is a good quality silicone spray like CRC Heavy Duty or NAPA. Don't use the foaming junk! Silicone does not collect dirt and dust like WD40. It is a clean lubricant. Spray the sliding boom, latches and hooks as well as the slide locks on top. After playing with the ladder right out of the box for a few minutes, I sprayed it with silicone. What a difference. It adjusts and glides into position smoothly. 34 pounds is not an issue. Move on up to the next level, which, for a change, is one you can actually see and touch.",3/24/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wattgate 381 AG Audio Grade Duplex Receptacle, Silver",Home Improvement,5,5,6,N,N,...and what remains is bestial.,"After spending an inordinate amount of time howling at the moon, my wolfen brothers and I ran through the arctic forests of Johanngeorgenstadt, Germany hot on the trail of the No-armed man. I could still hear that tragic, heart-wrenching melody of Do The Limbo Dance from the [[ASIN:B0000070S1 Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff]] concert where I had tracked the No-armed man and been ambushed by a lead pipe to the back of the head. Only now the shoe was on the other foot, and the three wolves and I chased after the No-armed man with the help of their keen sense of smell and the radioactive tin of [[ASIN:B000796XXM Uranium Ore]] I had been mashing against the side of my head for warmth.<br /><br />Finally, after thirty years, I saw the image I had burned into my retinas, the No-armed man running ahead of me, almost within my grasp. My wolfen brothers stopped me, knowing I would catch the No-armed man now, and said their farewells. This was not their war, as much as they may have wanted it to be, and knew that I must go on alone now. We laughed, we cried, we remembered many stories that we had shared, and then we parted ways.<br /><br />I ran after the No-armed man and quickly caught up to him at the edge of an enormous cliff. To one side of him flowed a massive river that dwarfed the Amazon, to the other side of him rose a sheer cliff, and behind him, a drop of nearly one mile to the placid surface of the lake below. And yet his deadliest choice was infront of him, me. It was then that I heard his voice for the first time and his words shocked me to my core.<br /><br />\\""I didn't murder, John W.

Ventamatic CX2500UPS Cool Attic 1650 CFM Energy Efficient Power Gable Mount Attic Vent,Home Improvement,2,1,2,N,Y,"POORLY DESIGNED, NOT BALANCED","Construction:<br />1. The fan shroud is flat with only one formed rib. This allows the shroud to contort once mounted causing the fan to hit the HEX head (should have been round-head) mounting bolts. Additionally, it is designed to be put into a PRE-CUT CIRCULAR HOLE of the exact size to give the shroud needed stability and prevent distortion to the shroud. *Plywood NOT INCLUDED.<br /><br />2. The available mounting slots in the shroud are limited to two choices which, AGAIN, limit you to a PRE-CUT CIRCULAR HOLE in a sheet of plywood for mounting.<br /><br />3. The electrical box is slightly undersized with no shielding for the 'hot' terminals going into the thermostat. An unshielded standard Romex ground can easily come into contact with either of the hot terminals if you're not EXTREMELY careful when putting the cover back on.<br /><br />4. There is no vibration padding/dampening anywhere at any of the mechanical connections.<br /><br />5. NOT BALANCED!!! The fan blade unit was either not balanced or the hub was not perfectly centered. It is vibrating and loud in the house.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I WOULD NOT recommend this fan.<br /><br /> This was a replacement fan for me. Because it was so flimsy and would not fit a straight top and bottom frame support, I disassembled it from its shroud housing and put it into my old shroud. Once in the sturdy shroud from my old unit, the fan had the balance issues; balance has to do with blades and would not change in a different shroud.

Grohe Hand Shower Set,Home Improvement,3,0,0,N,Y,Works as it should,"Installed in minutes and works fine. It is quite a bit smaller than your average sized hand shower, but larger than a typical kitchen sink sprayer. The included hose is only 4 feet long, which is a bit too short for my application. Luckily, a friend had an extra 5 foot Grohe hose that makes it much easier for me to get a good upwards spray where needed. The spray pattern is narrower than I would have liked (about a 1 inch diameter stream), but it does the job. Water only flows when the lever is pressed, so this unit is probably not a good choice for a single head setup.

Rinnai RU98IN 9.8 GPM Indoor Ultra-NOx Condensing Tankless Natural Gas Water Heater,Home Improvement,4,30,34,N,N,"Great Savings, Minor Inconveniences","I had this model Rinnai installed in February 2013, so I've been using it for 5 months now.<br /><br />Usage:<br />Usage is *almost* like when I had a tank water heater. There have been some minor annoyances. The biggest annoyance, and most reproducible, is when I shave. When I shave, I turn the hot water on, run the razor underneath, and turn it off again. Shave a section, water on, rinse razor, water off. Repeat. Eventually, the Rinnai decides that I'm not using any hot water and does not heat the water. Every single time I shave, I have to deal with eventually getting cold water from the tap when I ask for hot. I have called Rinnai tech support and they were unable to help with the issue. If not for this issue, I would give this model 5 stars.<br /><br />I think the culprit is a problem with their flow rate algorithm - I am actually using enough gpm (gallons/minute) to keep the heater on, if you average out my usage while shaving over a whole minute. However, during smaller windows of that minute I use 0 gpm and so the Rinnai's computer shuts off the heater. Rinnai, please fix this and you'll be rockstars.<br /><br />There is a smidgen of longer latency when you turn on the hot tap until when you get hot water, but it's hardly noticeable.<br /><br />Energy Usage:<br />During these periods I lived in a 2 person household with 4 bedrooms, and I switched from a large tank heater to a large tankless heater (this one). My natural gas usage during spring and summer months (not using the air heater) has dropped, on average, in half - from 12 therms/mo to 6 therms/mo. This only saves me about $6/mo, but I'm happy to reduce my environmental impact. I also have a gas stovetop and dryer, so my gas usage isn't all for hot water.<br /><br />I also measured the electricity used by this Rinnai - it uses about 0 watts when idle (as it should) and 30 watts when running. 30 watts is slightly more than I expected, but it at least does not run very often.<br /><br />Installation:<br/>You should know that this is not going to be a simple job to replace a traditional tank water heater due to these complications:<br /><br />* The RU98IN uses a dual venting system which combines intake and outtake in a special pipe. IIRC, the exhaust pipe is inside of the intake pipe in concentric circles. It may be a pain or impossible to run an additional vent, e.g. to the roof. In my case, it is mounted on the external wall so it vents through the wall outside.<br /><br />* The RU98 requires a 3/4\\"" gas line, and your tank water heater may have used a smaller line.<br /><br />* This RU98IN also has a condensate drain, and so you must locate the water heater near a drain. Warning: the condensate is somewhat acidic so if you have older iron drainpipes you may want to not install this system. On the plus side to the condensate drain, the condensate itself is a by-product of this unit efficiently burning natural gas - so there is a good reason for it.<br /><br />* The RU98 also requires an electrical outlet to be nearby. If you don't have one there already, you'd need one installed.<br /><br />Maintenance:<br />About once a year you should clean and flush the system to prevent scaling (flushing might only be in hard-water environments?).<br /><br />Update: I completed a maintenance cycle a year after installation. It was fairly easy and I used these Amazon products:<br />[[ASIN:B002NJ99PS PETRA X1109-8FF-TP Black Rubber Washing Machine Hose, 8 Foot]]<br />[[ASIN:B000X05G1A Superior Pump 91250 1/4 HP Thermoplastic Submersible Utility Pump]] (The pump works great, though it is higher velocity than is required)",7/22/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waterpik RainFall Showerhead with Adjustable Arm, Chrome #JP-130",Home Improvement,4,3,3,N,N,Great Product,"I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband. Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal. Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star. The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall. It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim. I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs. I've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again.",12/4/2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bagster 3CUYD Dumpster in a Bag,Home Improvement,1,299,349,N,N,If I could give negative stars,"DO NOT BUY A BAGSTER!!!!! The product itself seems to be fine.

I called customer service to find out the problem, and they had no information to give me but assured me that they would call me back and get it resolved. Next day no phone call and no pickup. Called back and got yes sir we will get it rescheduled and picked up ASAP. Three days pass and no call, etc. I call them back after noticing a $50 fee on my credit card from them. After speaking to a rep I asked to be transfer to a manger but was transfer to scheduling. Finally she transfers me to a manager. Then she tells me all sorts of BS about not being able to access the bagster in my driveway (BTW - my drive is 35 feet long and 11 feet wide with plenty of space to get in and out. Then they said it was obstructed by a Ford Explorer (There was no car in my driveway at the time plus I don't own Explorer and live alone). My question was why didn't the driver a) call me b) leave a note. Of course these questions cannot be answered. After asking for a refund for my $50 I get answer that she will forward it to her Ops Manager who will then decide if I get my money back. Of course I will never see this money again.<br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - if you can, pile the debris somewhere on your property cover it with a tarp and call a LOCAL junk/debris removal company.

Legend Wave Style Lever Handle Privacy Bed and Bath Leverset Lockset,Home Improvement,5,3,4,N,Y,Quality levers at a great price. See UPDATE after three years:,"These Legend handles were a great buy! They are attractive, sturdy and inexpensive when compared to their competition from the home improvement stores. This variation is the one you would use for a door you wish to have the option to lock, like a bathroom or bedroom door. There is a turn knob on one side of the levers. Included with each box is a two sided lever, a striker and a tumbler mechanism along with the required screws. We replaced ALL (21) of the doors knobs in our house with these types, some locking, some key-locked and some standard levers; they all look, feel and operate great. Installation was simple, too. The price of these levers was about two thirds that (64% to be exact) of the home improvement store. I handled (pun intended) the brand at the home improvement store and it felt to be of similar quality to these Legend levers. Overall, these were a great buy and they add a subtle elegance to our home versus our old builder-installed brass knobs.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/2017: These levers continue to look and function great! After almost three years installed, I have no real complaints. If I had to point to a few very minor nitpicks it would be that the outside levers (exposed to the elements) have had a bit of their finish wear off; I kind of give that a pass though. Also, some of the springs in the frequently used levers have weakened a bit and the lever hangs slightly below a perfect 90 degree angle...however for non OCDers that shouldn't be an issue. I still definitely recommend them.",1/13/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milwaukee Hand Trucks 30151 Flow Back Handle Truck with 7-Inch Puncture Proof Tires,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,Y,Very good handcart/dolly for home use,"I knew that I was going to move twice this year so I decided, after years of pondering, to purchase a dolly. I figured that they would be expensive but I was surprised when I found this one. I read some of the user reviews and the price I bought it at was a no brainer. If the previous reviews were wrong, then I wasn't out much money. Anyways, I have to say that this little guy is just right for light moves around the house. I would not recommend this for heavy use as I think it might not hold up. However, if you are moving, or move stuff around the garage or house and your back just isn't up for it anymore (like mine) then get this. If you're feeling like you might want something more then get a cart with inflated tires. But for home use this is more than adequate.",2/5/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tommy Bahama Ceiling Fans TB135DBZ Cabrillo Cove Tropical Ceiling Fan,Home Improvement,5,6,8,Y,N,"Balanced itself, really moves the air, lots of light, great quality","If you are short on patience or arms, you might want to choose the paddle-blades instead of the tropical blades. It comes with both sets. The tropical blades make it difficult to wire up, because they are wide, and you have to reach around them and really extend yourself to get everything wired correctly. It can be done though - my husband ended up reaching around it with one of the blades mashed against his face to wire it. It wasn't very comfortable, but it can be done.<br /><br />Installation at first went along amazingly simple, at the end of step 4 to step 5, I realized the directions in section 5 were for NO LIGHTS, and I needed lights, so make sure to pay attention there, as the book didn't seem all that clear to my husband, and he ended up having to redo the fan so we had a light.<br /><br />On 6.3 in the directions, it shows 2 wires just exposed hanging, and it doesn't tell you what to do with them. We put caps on each one. It would be nice if the instructions were more clear there. In any event, that did the trick and it worked.<br /><br />It came balanced and it is PERFECT. We didn't have to use a balancing kit at all. It works really well, it puts out a lot of wind - I could feel it across our kitchen/dining area, and our old fan could never be felt that far away.<br /><br />The hanger bracket and the hanger ball make it really easy to put into place while you do the wiring. In the past, we had ceiling fans where it took 2 people, but with this, you put the bracket up, and set the fan in it, and it holds it fine until it is wired up. We had a bit of a business interruption, so work on the fan had to be stopped for a day, but it hung in place until the next day when we could finish it.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated by the electronic receiver. My husband commented that it looked like an octopus with the wires coming out of it, but they are color coded and easy to match.<br /><br />We only have 8' ceilings, so we didn't extend it down, but it's fine for clearance when mounted 'short' for us. For inside use, you don't have to stuff the wires in this little box- so there's a bit more care that needs to be taken with the wires for outdoor use.<br /><br />For right now, I put it in my kitchen, and I love the color- it's a rich chestnut brown. I did have a white fan there, but the blades constantly showed any dirt, this one won't do that. Also it is a lot brighter than the one I had - the old one only had 2 lights, this one has 3. It comes with 3 compact florescent bulbs too, which was a nice bonus.<br /><br />The remote works well - it runs on a 9 volt battery that is included. It comes with a holder that mounts to the wall. They included a bit of extra hardware in case anything got dropped.<br /><br />It's a very solid attractive fan, and there's no wobbles at all, and it really moves the air. It's easy to see the quality of it by just looking at it. It's very well made..

I turned to trusty Amazon and found what I was looking for and it was less than half the price. The knob arrived on time and was an easy install. The directions also gave instructions on how to accommodate various door widths. If your in need of a quality knob at a good price, this should work for you.

Viribright Lighting 73547 Benchmark LED A19 10-watt 60-watt replacement lamp,Home Improvement,5,1,1,Y,N,Excellent Color and Photon Dispersion,"The ViriBright Benchmark LED bulb is an excellent quality bulb. Matrix Lighting has done an amazing job at mimicking the color temperature of a burning tungsten filament that we are used to with traditional incandescent 60 watt bulbs.<br /><br />Humans have evolved throughout the history of the world lighting their environments with fire. Campfires, candlelights, gas lantern, and incandescent bulbs. That is the core of the problem with CFL and LED bulbs to date... we want fire, we don't want the cold, pulsating, and frequency humming light generated by many of the CFL and LED bulbs sold today.<br /><br />But this ViriBright bulb offers what we want. A true 2900 color correlated temperature. I've seen other bulbs claim these numbers and lower, 2700 in one case, but no LED light I've seen comes this close to looking like a incandescent.<br /><br />This bulb is also running at 10 watts, which is a lot of bang for you wattage.<br /><br />For reference, here's some of the bulbs I've tested and use:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AYII2YE SWITCH - SWITCH75 - 18.5 Watt - 2700K Warm White - Clear LED Light Bulb - 1100 Lumen]] - This bulb is probably the reining all around champ. It's bright at 1100 Lumen, has a great color of 2700, solid build, and is liquid cooled so that you can put it in enclosed fixtures. But it runs at 18.5 watts and is expensive. It's also hot as hell after running for awhile. The light spreads evenly throughout the room.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006OTAE8Y Philips 418590 17-Watt A21 LED Household Light Bulb, Dimmable]] For the price, this is a great bulb. Perhaps the color looks a little too \\""orange\\"" and not enough \\""fire\\"". The light spreads well but is more directional than the Switch and the ViriBright. It's also bright at 1100 lumen. It runs at 17 watts. This is air-cooled, like the ViriBright, and cannot be placed in an enclosed fixture.<br /><br />I've used and tested other older technologies but would not buy these new bulbs new today, so I'll leave them out for now. If I was to buy new bulbs today, the ViriBright, the Switch, and the Philips are what will be added to my cart.<br /><br />An advantage of the ViriBright is that it is running at 10 watts, compared to the 18.5 and 17 in the above examples. The disadvantage is that it only outputs 800 lumens compared to the 1100 in the above examples. A disadvantage of the ViriBright and Philips bulb is that they cannot be placed in an enclosed fixture, the Switch can.

Mr. Beams MB722 Battery Powered Motion Sensing LED Stick Anywhere Night Light,Home Improvement,2,78,87,N,Y,Mounting restriction and short duration make for an annoying light,"I bought these to install in our bathrooms to provide a little ambient light so we wouldn't have to turn on the main lights at night. The sensor works well and the light is plenty bright (brighter than I prefer actually), but there are two things that really annoy me. First, the bracket requires that the light be installed as shown in the pictures - that is, the LED shines down. I wanted the opposite - I wanted to mount the lights near the ceiling, shining up, so that a soft reflected glow would light the room. The light is much more pleasing that way. The bracket doesn't allow this configuration (it falls off the wall if you try), so I ended up just using the double-side sticky tape to mount it the way I wanted. That's fine for now, but I worry I'm going to rip the paint off the wall when it's time to replace the batteries, not to mention the tape may not re-stick.<br /><br />The second problem is the short duration of the light. It only stays on for about 30 seconds, which is not enough time for me to finish my...umm...business in the middle of the night, leaving me standing at the toilet in total darkness. It doesn't work to wave my arm to re-activate it as the sensor is not sensitive enough for that. You have to move your whole body several inches, which is not a smart thing to do when you're peeing in total darkness. Worse, it does reactivate as I walk away, unnecessarily lighting an empty room for another 30 seconds.<br /><br />I don't know if another night light would have been a better choice, but knowing what I know now I wish I had done more research.",1/21/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genie 33950R Garage Door Opener Limit Switch for Genie,Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,Y,Same as the original,"Since I am reviewing four products today I will copy and paste this review into all four for easy cross reference for anyone else who goes through what I did. All four products came from Sanford and Son? Overhead Doors and fulfilled by Amazon. All four shipped quickly and arrived very fast. The three Genie parts were the same as the originals. I was replacing the Genie 34107R.S Screw Drive Carriage which had stripped and was no longer opening the door (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CST1L4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_14). I believe this stripped because the Limit Switches were installed in a shabby fashion on my garage door opener, the Genie Excelerator screw drive system, and the open limit switch (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00286CVAQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 ) stopped working (both switches, for some reason, the wires were run under the switch itself and srewed onto the rail, which caused them to strip over time because the wires were not tied down properly using the clips; versus just using the clips and tying the excess wire in a loop with a twist tie at the end closest the power head assembly) . The Excelerator will shut off when enough force is exerted on the bumper mechanism, so even though the open limit switch stopped working the door would stop once it pushed hard enough against the bumper. However, this use of force to shut down the system over time wore down the screw drive carriage (took a little over a month for me). Since the close door limit switch (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283OBXY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8) had also been installed improperly and also seemed like it was having problems (sometimes it seemed to work, sometimes it seemed force was taking over) I decided to replace the whole setup. So, two new limit switches, a new screw drive carriage, and a tube of the grease folks seemed to recommend over the higher priced Genie brand 3 pack (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJ07W2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) and I'm back in business. I am no expert, believe me, but the install of all three was a very easy one person job. Simply release the carriage from the Curved Door Arm, unscrew the one screw from the Head Bracket, and lift the rail high enough to slip off the old drive carriage. Have the new carriage ready to go and slip that right on. Lower the rail back on the head bracket and screw it back in place. Reconnect to the Curved Door Arm. The limit switches unscrew and screw easily back on. The wire clips just pop off very easily and are easy to reuse. The new limit switches do not come with the screws that hold them in place, so make sure to keep your existing screws because you will need to reuse them. I used the clips to hold down excess limit switch wire until I reached the Power Head Assembly, and then I just rolled up the rest of the excess, tied it up with a twist tie, and laid that on top of the Power Head Assembly. The greasing directions that Genie provides with their grease (available here from the Homedepot site ([...]) has you wipe down the rail before you put the new grease, and then wiping off excess once you grease the screw drive shaft. Not sure how necessary that is, but I did it, and then found I needed to do a few runs of grease along the rail to lube it up right. Maybe they meant wipe off mess that does not go on the drive shaft or rail...because you need the grease on those. One final note, once I reassembled eveything I realized the rail was not straight because the carriage was moving on an angle. It turns out that the Rail Strap had bent (this thing is heavy metal) presumably because of force causing the door to stop closing instead of the close limit switch. I had to go back and take that off and bend it by hand to straighten it out. Two months later and all is working...although I need to hire somebody to come out and balance my door because I realized when I took everything apart that the door came down very hard when not connected to the system and it should almost be balanced and not go down at all. Since balancing a door could be a bit dangerous I am choosing not to try that.",1/25/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GE GEH50DEEDSR GeoSpring Hybrid Electric Water Heater - Energy Star,Home Improvement,5,9,10,N,N,How I Cut My Energy Bill for Water Heating by 76%,"My home's nineteen-year-old LP Gas water heater was starting to show its age: brown rusty water, high gas bills, and a gas smell every time we went into the garage. While the old gas water heater still worked, we didnâ€™t want to wait and be stuck with no hot water and a 2 year old needing her bath time. It was time to begin looking for a new water heater.<br />My wife and I had noticed many commercials advertising the efficiency of instant gas water heaters. Even our gas company had a deal with financing. After asking a professional on Green Home Guide we focused our search on finding a heater that has a high â€œEnergy Factorâ€ (EF).<br />We researched the following water heating technologies:<br />1. Solar thermal: The best on energy factor however didnâ€™t meet our budget and had to be installed on the south side of our roof which was the front of the house. My wife didnâ€™t like that.<br />2. LP Gas tankless: The energy factor is around .94 and is consider by most to be more efficient than the LP Gas tank water heater we currently had at .63 efficiency. Honestly this was the one we thought we would go with from the start. However, I would advise you to weigh the pros and cons before purchase. We found out we would need a water softener to prolong the heat exchanger, warranty coverage, and a larger duct vent through the roof than the one we currently had. A three to four inch duct vent is required. This added 40% to the original price quote. We also noticed a lot of false promises on true savings.<br />3. Electric tankless: The energy factor was comparable to the gas instant/tankless. However we needed to upgrade our electrical panel for the install because the electric instant water heater pulls more amps than the standard tank water heater. Plus they advised us a water-softener or pre-filter would be a good idea too.<br />4. Hybrid water heater: This product appealed to us because it was the most innovative and had the highest efficiency -- EF 2.35. Plus it was a lot cheaper than going thermal solar water heating. It also still qualified for the Energy Star tax credit, and was more efficient than gas instant or electric instant water heating.<br />We decided to buy the hybrid, a GeoSpring Hybrid-Electric Heat-Pump Hot Water Heater.<br />What ultimately made me buy a Geo Spring water heater?<br />There are several factors I considered.<br />â€¢ The product and the GE website information were great.<br />â€¢ High efficiency over conventional models without having to go thermal solar. I understand thermal solar watering heating is the best. However so is the hybrid water heater in my opinion and the return on investment is shorter.<br />â€¢ Price was less than going thermal solar with having to install panels on my roof.<br />â€¢ No commission to a sales person.<br />â€¢ Warranty.<br />â€¢ Tax write off! Use IRS tax form 5695.<br />â€¢ Easy to install. I didnâ€™t have to install a gas tank, or cut holes in my roof to go thermal solar. I could put it in myself! This one was a big reason for me! I like things done right and other ways to learn about appliances or ways to save energy and protect the environment at the same time.<br />From $1,038 per year to $250.56 per year<br />Based on DOE test procedure, my projected energy costs for water heating with the GeoSpring will go from $1,038/year to $250.56, a reduction of 76%. That means I'll recoup a return on investment (ROI) in less than two years, not counting the $300 Energy Star tax deduction or the 27% reduction in kWh rate I'll get from my utility by moving into a lower usage tier. My cost for the GeoSpring water heater was $1,356 and I installed it myself. I estimate it would cost $300 to have a licensed plumber install it.<br />I should mention Iâ€™m a Florida State electrical contractor, active RESNET Class 1 HERS Rater, and I installed this unit myself. However, that didnâ€™t mean I knew how to install one of these or knew all the answers on efficiency. I found several YouTube videos on how to install one of these and read the installation instructions front to back, picked up the material I would need to do the job and installed it without any problems. I think it took me longer to take that old LP Gas water heater out and clean and paint the area prior to installing the new heater.<br />I should also mention it works great. My wife is happy with plenty of hot water, no complaints, plus we have a garden Jacuzzi tub and it filled it up with plenty of hot water. I keep the setting in the eHeat (most efficient EF 2.55) mode most of the year and in the Hybrid (EF 2.35) mode in the winter months in Florida.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary<br />Please do your own research. I live in Florida where the Geo Spring Hybrid will work great because itâ€™s warm most of the year and the incoming ground water temperature is around 75 degrees.<br />However, if I lived in Ohio I would never install one of these because the temperature split is too high. The incoming ground water temperature there would be around 55 degrees. Most people would require LP Gas or Natural Gas fuel to heat more efficiently in that climate.<br />What should you check prior to installing a Geo-Spring water heater?<br />Location: The GeoSpring gives off 56-db of noise which is less than a box type fan running. If installing indoors fan noise, space required, and condensation drain will have to be considered. If installing in a closet the door will have to be vented to allow air to circulate around Heat-Pump. This unit works best with 700 cubic feet of air around unit for proper air circulation. I installed mine in the garage where itâ€™s warmer and has space around it to evaporate the warm air to heat the water more efficiently.<br /><br />Climate: Southern states in my opinion would be the best option on increased energy savings.<br /><br />Cost: Check around, I purchased mine at Lowe's and extended the warranty up to 10 years for $80 dollars after the one year warranty runs out.<br /><br />Contractor: Are they licensed? Did they pull a permit?<br /><br />Needs: Do I need a 40 gallon, 50 or an 80? Geo-Spring only comes in a 50 gallon at this time. However we have a garden Jacuzzi tub and it fills it up just fine with plenty of hot water.<br /><br />Full article: http://greenhomeguide.com/how-i-cut-my-energy-bill-for-water-heating-by-76",3/10/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife has been asking for a simplistic solution to bring some sort of filtration to our shower and this product fit the bill. Installation was easy....but I did have to pull out the channel locks to get it done. Recommendation...when using channel lock pliers with this, simply wrap a paper towel or small towel around the area where you will use the pliers...it will avoid unsightly scratches.<br /><br />With well water comes low pressure - which is a problem for us using any shower head. However, I was quite impressed with this shower head. I simply removed the water saving restrictor - as per the instructions - and installed the shower head. While its not the BEST shower I have had...it is adequate for most low pressure situations.....especially because the shower head has an easy to turn dial with multiple spray/massage configurations.<br /><br />Great value, great filtration, and excellent settings.",11/11/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Zenna Home 600W Shower Rod Cover, 60"" x 1"" x 1""",Home Improvement,5,27,29,N,Y,Such a simple thing so helpful,"I am SO GLAD I found this on Amazon as you can't find them much or at all in stores locally it seems.<br /><br />This simple little inexpensive and uncomplicated invention makes a big difference in one of those little ways that matter.<br /><br />How many times and ways do we experience \\""little\\"" annoyances that happen all too often. Nothing major but a source of irritation. Like, for instance, taking a nice shower after working outside getting ready to relax and chill but its always annoying hitting that little bump in the middle of the shower rod that sometimes leaves the curtain coming off one or two of the hooks which have to be put back eventually before the hooks fall off. Or the fact that it just looks messy. But mostly for me its that \\""struggle\\"" every time I shower.<br /><br />This hasn't revolutionized my world, I haven't experienced any huge financial changes one way or the other on account of it. It just makes my life a little smoother and that's nice.<br /><br />Everytime I get out of the shower now I am reminded of what's missing, that annoying tug. And I admit I feel a little smug because I found an answer to something that's no big deal. It is, however, something I think a lot of people have just learned to live with. How can something so small be so nice and make me so glad I found, for this one \\""issue\\"" in my life - an answer.<br /><br />The only thing I would say as advice as to \\""how to\\"" install it is that you will probably have to cut off a few inches from one end or the other. That's what I did which was no big deal. Thing is, though, there is a sticker on one end (manufacturers seem to LOVE STICKERS that you can't UN-STICK to save yourself) that is aesthetically a small blemish detracting from the \\""tidiness\\"" I like. If I had noticed ahead of time there was this sticker which is about an inch and a half long that is the end I would have cut off but as luck happens so often, if there is a 50-50 chance of getting it \\""right\\"" I got it wrong. So I had to try to scratch off this sticker thing which I wasn't totally successful at but \\""enough\\"" to get by. It's not a huge thing but nice if you get it right and cut off the sticker end instead of the unblemished part. That's the only thing that could have made this nicer. I HATE STICKERS. What is the love affair anyway with stickers that defy removing? I don't notice it much or at all, I just know its there and it would have been better without it.<br /><br />Anyway, with or without the sticker this has made my life more pleasant in one of those little simple ways that makes me a happier person. Who knew happiness comes in such small ways? A NICE, SMOOTH addition to an otherwise \\""rough\\"" world - and it doesn't cost a fortune, the shipping was SUPER FAST, actually delivered by a carrier service within a couple of days which was a nice surprise too. I highly recommend it so you too, can be among the smugly self-satisfied who don't have to tug at the shower curtain AGAIN, a solution easy, fast and cheap. What could be better?<br /><br />I'm glad they had an option here on Amazon to buy JUST ONE because I don't need a box of 20. The option I found for one combined with the shipping fee was still probably cheaper than if I had found one locally. It pays to shop around and check your options.So I had to try to scratch off this sticker thing which I wasn't totally successful at but \\""enough\\"" to get by.

"Zoeller 30-0181 1-1/2"" PVC Check Valve with Slip Unions,",Home Improvement,5,55,58,N,N,"Excellent quality, 1 1/4"" full flow - does ""klunk""","This review is being written 6/9/2013 for the Zoeller 30-0181 Check Valve, 1-1/2 Inch, sold and shipped by third party vendors who advertise on the Amazon website.<br /><br />The precursor to this model had a slightly different design where the valve came apart in the middle with four bolts, and the flapper was a replaceable item. This model is sealed and the flapper is not replaceable. This valve has the same rugged flapper design (reinforced with a metal disk) as the previous design. The flapper opens completely, unlike many cheaper valves, hence the \\""full-flow\\"" claim. However, do note that this check valve is a 1 1/4\\"" design with universal rubber couplings that connect it to either 1 1/4\\"" or 1 1/2\\"" PVC pipe. Therefore, if you use 1 1/2\\"" PVC piping, you will not get the same amount of flow through this valve as you would with a model that has a 1 1/2\\"" minimum diameter. This design allows Zoeller to sell one product with a single set of rubber couplers for both applications. Turn the rubber couplings one way or the other to accommodate the correct PVC pipe diameter for your application. Also note that this check valve does \\""klunk\\"" with a loud snap. If you are concerned about the noise, you may want to consider another model with a different design. Otherwise, if you want a reliable, high quality check valve, this is a good choice.<br /><br />I've uploaded some pictures to show the full flow design and the orientation of the rubber couplers.",6/10/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polished Brass Ceiling Fan Light Kit Fixture Combo. The brass style blends seamlessly with many decor styles.,Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,Y,Fit my ceiling fan perfectly.,"I attached it to a Craftmade Model P152 fan. It fit perfectly. Should work on any fan that accommodates a universal light fixture with threaded nipple. The picture does not show it, but there is a threaded nipple protruding from the top of the fixture for installation to the fan. For the Craftmade, I had to remove the plastic button in the bottom center of the fan control housing (where the fan switches are). This light fixture then threads right in. My fan already had wires in the housing for a light fixture, so I just had to attach the two wires from this fixture to those wires. The brass on the fixture is bright brass, but it does have a more buffed look than the mirror-like finish of the fan I attached it to. I can't imagine anyone noticing the difference unless it is pointed out to them. Note that this fixture does not come with shades for the light bulbs. It uses shades with a standard 2 1/4&#34; base, which you can get from a home supply store or here from Amazon.",6/28/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restore Deck Restore Kit,Home Improvement,4,5,8,N,N,Finished about 1/3 of my 560 sqft deck...,"This is a review of my experience in using Restore. I am still in the process of finishing the deck so obviously I do not have any long term results. What I can offer is how easy/difficult it was to apply, texture, coverage, too hot? etc.<br /><br />Coverage: Their website states that 1-4 gallon container will cover a 100 sq-ft area with 2 coats. I used just over 2-4 gallon containers to cover a 14x15 area (or 210 sq-ft) with 2 coats. I also did all the top rails and a few stairs with 2 coats. So, the coverage was spot on (if not better). Why was it spot on for me but poor for others? One possible explanation is that the weather has been relatively cool for this time of the year.<br /><br />Texture: I am specifically looking for the textured feel as we have kids and have friends and family over often for the pool. The texture turned out exactly how I was hoping and am extremely happy. We are not having any issues with it being way too rough to walk on or as others have described, \\""like walking on rocks\\"". Why did the texture turn out ok for us? Possible explanations can be read below...<br /><br />How easy/difficult to apply (and prep): Use their rollers. Do all the necessary prep work - power wash (sand if necessary), mask off any areas (like you house). Their website talks about applying extra material to nail holes and larger cracks before you do the 2nd coat. I took the extra step to fill in any larger cracks and deep nail holes with caulk before I did the first coat (their website also talks about using caulk if necessary). I did this before the first coat because I wanted to eliminate filling in b/t the 1st and 2nd coat. It worked. Filling in the larger nail holes and cracks took some time but not as long as you think - quick bead then swipe with putty knife. I think it saved me time in the long run - plus you don't have to constantly stop and fill stuff in while you're just trying to focus on using the roller. Its just roll and go (in onedirection). I also brushed a light coat of the Restore solid stain in between the deck boards before I applied the thick stuff. This will greatly improve the visual appearance once the thick stuff is applied. I suggest using both the smaller and larger rollers - the smaller works great in the tighter areas. It will be somewhat weird when first applying but just like with anything new you'll find your rhythm. The first coat will be blotchy but the 2nd coat will fill it in nicely. First coat dry time was quick - 3 or 4 hours but I waited til the next day to put the 2nd coat on. I learned that the thicker you put the 2nd coat on AND the less you roll and re-roll over it the better the texture will turn out (less \\""rocky\\""). The material will start to lay down as it dries - rolling over it too much causes it to lay less and get \\""rocky\\"", IMO. About it being too hot to walk on - I can't really say much on that yet b/c it has been relatively cool in our area for this time of the year. What I can say is this - we have 2 decks - the pool deck is composite and the larger deck is PT. Before Restore both decking materials got extremely hot in the direct sun (with the composite being the worst). We put a few outdoor rugs down and problem solved. So, will the Restore get hot? I would imagine.<br /><br />TIPS: I used a roller grid that went right in the bucket vs a pan. Much easier IMO. I bought a $6 mixer and just left it in the bucket behind the roller grid - this allowed me to quickly attach the drill and mix if necessary (I did not have to mix that much - maybe twice per coat). I used a putty knife to scrape out the excess product that oozed in b/t the boards and scraped this on the next board I was going to do - no need to waste the product. Lightly re-roll to knock down where you scraped in b/t the boards - done.<br /><br />I've finished @ 1/3 of my deck (@200 sq-ft) with 2 coats - took me 6 hours to apply the thick stuff. So, I'm looking at another 12 tofinish the deck - but won't be surprised if it takes less time. The majority of my time invested in this project has been the prep work. Sure, putting the thick stuff down takes a little extra time but, if I'm being honest, once you find your rhythm it's easy to put down. So, if you're considering doing the Restore - don't let the negative reviews steer you away - just make sure you prep, follow the instructions and take your time. After all, if you're supposed to get 8-10 yrs out of it (gimme 5 years and I'll take it) - don't you think it might take a little longer to put down? Oh, and I never added any water. Good luck Restoring...",7/2/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speakman S-2253 Classic Anystream High Pressure Adjustable Shower Head,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,Y,HOLY !!,HOLY !!! This is it I finally found a shower head that is really high powers. THIS IS THE 4 hole one they have a six also. But more holes mean less pressure .so I opted for this one. I hooked it up and man really powerful on my low flow apt water.Then I read to take out the mandatory water restricters. ONE ARTICAL SAID TO JUST OPEN OR LOOK INTO THE NECK BALL JOINT AREA OF WHERE YOU SCREW THE SHOWER HEAD ON.AND TAKE OUT THE TINY BLACK RUBBER O RING. NEED A LONG NEEDLE TO PRICK OUT THE O RING . PRETTY EASY BUT LITTLE.THEN I PUT BACK ON. HOLY !!! Again it at least doubled the pressure on a ALREADY great head..it will knock you over almost. I love it.So don't drill out or mess with the white plastic built in flow part: leave it in. only take the black o RING out. if you mess with that part it can and will mess up break. the best shower headyou ever got.

"SentrySafe H4300 Fire-Safe Waterproof Security File, 0.7 Cubic Feet, Silver Gray",Home Improvement,4,113,118,N,Y,"Nice Size, Good Features","I have a number of Sentry Safes, they are fireproof for a length of time and this is the first one I've bought that is also waterproof, another nice feature. Their locks are make for locking, they're not real tamperproof, as I found when I lost the keys for my 1170 model and we were able to pick the lock within several minutes. In case you happen to have an 1170, this one opens a bit differently. With the 1170, you put the key in, turn it and can pick up the lid. With the H4300SG, after you unlock it, you have to press down on the lid while gripping and pulling up the lid at the same time. This probably serves the purpose whereas if the safe is unlocked and knocked over, the lid won't flop pen and possibly let items fall out. If you deal with something like bad arthritis in your hands, you might find opening the H4300SG a bit difficult. The Sentry safes do serve their purpose at a reasonable price; they don't take the place of a safe deposit box.

Ivation 2-LED Super Bright (46 Lumens) Automatic Motion & Light Sensing Nightlight - Battery Powered & Stick-Anywhere Design - Wall Mounts Included,Home Improvement,5,18,22,N,N,Turns ON During A Power Outage!,"The power goes off in the middle of the night and you are left to fumble for a flashlight in a drawer - if you have one. Or, you need to get up and walk to the bathroom or anywhere and need a readily available flashlight. This is HIPE's newest multi-function light and it's so easy to use.<br /><br />The unit is a tray that plugs into the wall socket and the flashlight sits in the well - charging (simple induction). It has a three-prong plug, but this can be rotated at 90-degrees to fit the situation. The tray has a Â½\\"" thick LED blue light that stays on for a permanent nightlight. You can set the unit to ON, OFF or AUTO. The bottom switch is not labeled well, so you need to experiment a bit.<br /><br />In the middle of the night, if the power goes off, the Light automatically lights up. The six (6) bluish LED lights are very bright and will illuminate the room easily. The button on the side will light the flashlight with one press. A second press will put it into strobe mode. A third press turns it off. I would suggest placing this near your bed for convenience.<br /><br />When there is a black-out, the HIPE light will stay on until power is restored. I have not experienced this yet with my unit, but the idea of it not turning off means it will drain down. When you are done, simply switch the button to OFF. This will start to recharge when power goes back on. Because it is powered by an internal Lithium Ion battery, you never need replacement batteries. Remember those heavy flashlights with the Size 'D' batteries? Those are history and when you compare the price of this light to any ordinary flashlight, you'll wonder what took this invention so long to arrive.<br /><br />Like all of HIPE products, they are environmentally friendly. This unit was generously supplied to me for an honest review.",9/1/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SkyBell SkyBell Wi-Fi Video Doorbell with Motion Sensor - Version 2.0,Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,N,Skybell Wi-Fi Video Doorbell 2.0 - I like it,"I want to say up front that I had a marvelous experience with tech support. Rosemary V. was very attentiveness and had a genuine desire to assist the customer. I am happy with my new Skybell wi-fi video doorbell 2.0.

As I was resolving the band issue, my doorbell chime still worked with Skybell mounted and before it was fully functional. Skybell works well with my Samsung Galaxy s6 Edge.

Speakman Icon Anystream High Pressure Adjustable Shower Head,Home Improvement,5,5,5,N,Y,Just spend the money -- it's worth it.,"I had a basic-model Speakman in the 1990s. It was all brass, solid as a rock, simple in design and function, and probably cost about $30 at the time I purchased it. The thing would probably be still working for me, but I tossed it into garage storage when I remodeled the bathroom, and opted for a high-priced, oh-so-fancy, multi-jet shower head from a company I won't mention. When that supposedly indestructible shower head needed to be replaced due to water streaming out the side seam (!), I looked around for my old Speakman. Gone. Probably donated to Goodwill by accident. So I went online and looked for a basic Speakman. Plastic! They are all plastic now. Then I saw this baby, and I was smitten. Old-school quality, even if it does come at a new-age price. I am pleased as can be after installing and using it. The overall design could not be cleaner, the chrome plating is thick and has a gorgeous gloss, the handle moves smoothly and evenly to move through the range of flow. I love the fine spray for most washing, while the &#34;pour&#34; setting is great for rinsing hair. No snazzy bells and whistles here, just a good, solid shower head that should last many years.<br /><br />I think the reviewers complaining of inadequate water pressure may be talking about low water volume, which is a different issue. The strength of the spray this provides is quite good for a low-flow unit. I live in California, where every drop counts.<br /><br />(One nice little detail is that Speakman provides the pipe tape necessary for installation, so don't buy any here, as I did.)",5/2/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under Cabinet LED Lighting 21 LED 3 Panel Deluxe Kit pack-parent,Home Improvement,5,0,0,N,N,Easy Beautiful System Made My Dreams Come True,"I love this lighting system. It makes me giggle because I had two men (an electrician and my husband) tell me that I couldn't have what I wanted for under cabinet lighting and this system gave it to me with the least amount of work and destruction. I wanted a regular light switch to turn them on (one on each side of the room was acceptable), and despite one side of cabinets being broken up by a window, I wanted those to come on with one switch too. The problem is that I have a two story house. They said that holes would need to be punched through the ceiling and the electrician said that we'd need to be concerned about the total load. Fortunately we were making this decision before tiling the back splash so we were able to run the connection, under the window and behind the wall, without any major destruction.<br /><br />One piece of advice I'd offer is to be certain you know whether you want the cool bright light system or the warm lights. Newer appliances, like my exhaust hood, use the brighter blue light leds and the lights we've all been using in our homes are more like the \\""warm\\"" lights. If you mix lights, chances are that the difference will scream out at you, and/or the \\""bright\\"" lights will feel too harsh.<br /><br />I should probably tell you that I purchased this same system through their online store. We needed additional pieces that this kit doesn't include and so it made more sense to buy it direct. We had to run one wire behind the wall for the cabinets separate by a window and the company offers that wire on their site. However, I did buy additional connectors through Amazon. It might be helpful to know that the website has videos that were very helpful in aiding us with our decisions, as well as helping us know what to expect. IMO, this company is tops for those looking to update lighting with ease, at a reasonable price that is actually relatively inexpensive when compared to others.",6/30/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cook'n Recipe Organizer Version 10,Software,4,2,3,N,N,Great customer support & great product,"I have been using Cook'n since version 7. It is an easy program to learn and use with lots of options. I live in Australia so the measures are metric rather than imperial. Last year I lost a good deal of data (includinging my personal recipe files) from a failed computer. This SHOULD have taught me a lesson.<br /><br />When I upgraded to Version 10, I had difficulties restoring my databases. This is not the fault of Cook'n, rather my own lack of diligence with backing up data appropriately. I have to start from scratch AGAIN with my Cook'n. Some recipes are lost forever I feel but maybe I have learnt with time to make appropriate backups.<br /><br />Getting back to the program, it can be as simple or as complicated as you like. I do not use menus or indeed shopping lists most of the time but I still come back to Cook'n for its ease of use and flexibility.<br /><br />The only beef I have with Cook'n is the printing side of things. As I am in Australia, paper sizes are not the same as the US but with a little tweaking, I can get around that. More printing options would be nice but that's on the wishlist.<br /><br />I must say that DVO's customer service is great. I lost my purchased cookbooks but the DVO team were able to resend me what ones they could considering that I purchased them over 4 years ago. What book they couldn't send me, they offered a free download of any book I liked. All this done in a matter of 2 short days and only a couple of emails.

Adobe Premiere Elements 10,Software,2,3,5,N,N,Does NOT Make HD Movies for Legacy Players,"I have used five generations of Adobe Premiere, all the way back to version 1.5. While it is still a good editor with some strong features, the latest version, PE 10 flagrantly misrepresents its capability. It states on the box \\""Burn Blu-ray quality HD movies using standard DVD discs and burners.\\"" This statement is under the heading \\""Share videos...with friends wherever they are\\"". The problem is that your friends will have to buy a new \\""1080 HD DVD Player\\"" in order to take advantage of this feature. Adobe does not specify that their new feature requires new hardware and therefore it is misleading and caused me to waste a good deal of time trying to find an explanation on their website. Not to mention that the claim that it works with any HD video camera is simply not true. It worked with my older camcorders, but not my new Sony.<br />On the other hand, the software does a fine job of basic editing and is particularly good at rendering discs because it has good control over the menu text and icon placement and has an excellent DVD preview screen so you don't have to burn DVDs to know if your menus launch the scenes correctly. Rendering to all formats is impressively fast and the Win 7 64 bit implementation is robust and only crashes occasionally.<br />More problems with PE are caused by Adobe's strategy to attempt to persuade users to use this product as the nexus of all their stored video and still media. Anybody who is serious about video editing will have a host of programs including viewers, converters and other editors. PE's cumbersome attempt to grab all the media files results in screens popping up unexpectedly that take you out of the core editing experience. This was never the case in the older products. Bad product direction for serious video editors. Also bothersome are their frequent attempts to pull users into using the related suite of Photoshop products, no doubt because they are losing market share to Picasa and other free photo editing programs.<br />This product is now no better than the Cyberlink competitor and the only reason I remain an Adobe user is that I am familiar with their menus.",5/23/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Poser Pro [OLD VERSION],Software,1,10,13,N,N,"Quality OK for Freeware, but not for a $500 Product!","Review of Smith Micro's Poser Pro Well, at this juncture I've been working almost daily with this product, and thought it was high time I shared some of my impressions with other prospective customers/victims. First of all, as a long-time software professional, I am quite aware of the complexities associated with 3D rendering, and the high demand on processing resources -- both memory and CPU. Even though I'm running a fairly capable machine (quad-core, 64-bit, 8Gig of ram, 2 - 1-terrabyte drives, Win XP-64, etc.), I am prepared to accept that complex 3D scene rendering will take some time. That said, what I DO NOT accept is the necessity for the program to outright refuse to render, or even LOAD some scenes, reporting \\""not enough memory to load texture map'! In software engineering terminology, this just indicates sloppy memory management. Even after researching the issues, tweaking the render settings, running a 3rd-party memory management utility -- the problem persists. Perhaps even harder to excuse is the generally brittle nature of the package. It regularly becomes necessary to resort to ctl-alt-del, bring up the program manager, find the process, and use the \\""kill process tree\\"" command to get rid of the hung application, and then start the whole process over from the start, often losing work in the process. Then, of course, there are the incessant \\""An unexpected exception occurred: -50\\"" messages. Once again, ctrl-alt-del, etc., is the only way to proceed. Don't even bother looking in the event manager, or searching for a log that might explain the source of the problem. The Poser \\""engineers\\"" apparently considered such niceties as superfluous. Interestingly, it's often possible (and necessary) to load a scene that Poser Pro refuses to accept by using Poser 7! I can then eliminate some elements, save the file, and reload back into Poser Pro. Did someone decide it was necessary to introduce some additional bugs into the flagship package.? Ialso have a strong suspicion that the program suffers from some severe memory leaks. If you monitor memory usage, you'll see that, regardless of the nature of the scene, memory usage just keeps on increasing, until, inevitably -- that's right: ctrl-alt-del. The thing that amazes me most, is the proliferation of gushing reviews of this shoddy piece of . . . programming. Are the reviewers on Smith Micro's payroll? Have they done any more with it than render a quick naked woman, gawk over it, and then write: \\""WOW, what a GREAT product!\\""? There are, of course, so many other annoying quirks as to defy enumeration here. Suffice it to say, that this is an extremely irritating program with which to work. Smith Micro touts this as a \\""professional package,\\"" an utterly absurd assertion. It's quality is such that I might overlook the bugs in a freeware package, but certainly not in something costing nearly five-hundred bucks. Oh well, there's a sucker born every minute. Now, as someone who has watched my own company's profits eroded by software piracy, I am generally opposed to such abuses, however, in cases like this, my advice is to acquire the product from someplace like Emule, or Vuse, or other torrent servers, use it for a while, and if you still think it's worth the asking price, then by all means, write that check. Otherwise, just use it at a cost that's precisely what it's worth: $0.",7/8/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Rack 2 Filer V5.0,Software,3,31,33,N,N,Pretty and easy but proprietary database is not so great idea,"Received with ScanSnap S1500. Goods: 1. Relatively easy to use and organize without having to use windows file system. Good for the non-computer geek who just wants to get rid of the paper but have a things organized in binders and folders. Others: 1. To attempt to minimize software piracy (I don't blame them) there is a relatively complex installation which failed in my case on several attempts. Support helped me get around this problem within a few days and were very helpful and responsive. But, if I ever need to reinstall or move to another computer (if you are scanning your life aren't you going to take it with you to the next computer?) I can expect it to be difficult. 2. The main problem with this program is the proprietary database. The file and folder naming structure in windows is not representative of what you called the files and folders in the program when you scanned them (unlike the default program that comes with the scanner). This mean that you need to use the program to find the files and if you ever no longer have this program or access to it (see number 1 above or if you are using Windows 10 ten years from now and this program is no longer supportable), all your scanning work will be for naught and you will have a bunch of folders and files with gobledegook for names.

I no longer attempt to use the budgeting feature, we use excel and manually patch the data back into Quicken. I have mobile completely disabled (it added corrupt data).

I'm happy to report that I haven't had any data corruptions recently--for a couple of months. The mobile/iOS experience is still not working. Now every time I try to use it recently I get a \\""Data Error\\"" and it boots me completely out. That is to say it requires that I go back an re-enter my UN and PW as opposed to simply the iOS program PIN. Then it simply gives the same error and requires a sign out. I may delete the account and create a new one, again, to see if that fixes it as it has in the past. As you can gather from my review above and other users, it hasn't been sufficiently reliable for me to consistently use it, so I can't say it's a huge loss for me. However, if you view it as a big selling point, don't purchase this software for this feature.<br /><br />There are many bugs that are still not worked out (again, venture over to Quicken's support forum). My view on the software is still the same. This is not an adequately vetted program and is still not ready for public release. If you MUST upgrade for some reason, such as banking compatibility, it's tolerable--at least you won't lose data (well, maybe). I still backup frequently. The only reason I'd say that's a remotely acceptable option is because there are no real competitors here. My rating stands at 1 of 5 stars.",10/8/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Imagine a third grader enjoying creative writing instead of silly computer games! I'm sure this will give her an advantage in the upper grades when she has to type assignments and reports.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 11 [Old Version],Software,1,5,5,N,Y,Will Not Work on My Windows 7 Computer,"I installed this today and after a few hours, tons of searching for a solution online, and plenty of messing with my computer settings, I am throwing the towel in. I continually get an error message that the &#34;Sound Level is Too Low&#34; and I cannot even get past the profile setup wizard due to this error. The headphones included with the software are either junk, or the software itself has an error with Windows 7. A user forum I was reading mentioned that if you call Nuance with this problem they will spend plenty of time making sure you checked all the obvious solutions, then they apologize and tell you they have a software glitch they are working on. I haven't subjected myself to this process, and I don't plan on it, either. No product should require this much work just to get it to function adequately.<br /><br />Well, a glitch working with Windows 7 is a big deal. I am computer savvy, I can build a PC from parts, I can install software, I can change system settings in Control Panel, and I can troubleshoot simple problems better than most computer users. I checked every single listed solution I was able to try, and I simply cannot get this software to run properly. If this is a known bug, as it seems to be, then this product should not be sold as compliant with Windows 7. I am returning this, there is no way I plan on spending even more time and effort getting this to work. I checked the microphone function with the Windows Sound Recorder, and while it is a bit low, it records just fine. So, either the issue is the included headset (hopefully Nuance is not hair-brained enough to send out a faulty headset that will make their software look like garbage) -or- the problem is that their software is buggy and doesn't run properly on my new, clean, non-buggy computer.",1/10/2013,0,0,i,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011,Software,5,6,10,Y,N,Easy to use somewhat powerful paint program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if u are not already one,"I loved this product. It's a paint/photo program, not a drawing program. Adobe Photoshop (AP) is a paint/photo program; Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a drawing program. AP creates bitmap files, and AI create vector files. Bitmap files are images made up of little dots. Whereas vector files are mathematical formulas that are easily scaleable. The native files for Sketchbook are stored in layered TIF format, but they can be exported in many different bitmap file formats: gif, jpeg, and PSD.<br /><br />I have used quite a number of different kinds of computer applications over the years: wordprocessing, spreadsheet, presentations, database, email, WYSIWYG Web page designers, paint/photo, and drawing. Of all these different types of computer programs I have had the most difficulty learning to use well the paint/photo kind. This is probably because I am not really an artist - at least not one adept at creating visual pictures using my hands. I am much better at taking photos with a digital camera and tweeking them using Adobe Photoshop. I have always found AP to be a tough cookie when it comes to creating original artwork from scratch.<br /><br />Sketchbook Pro makes it much easier for me to create original artwork from scratch. It is designed to be used with a digital pen tablet. The intuitive user interface is slick and pleasing to eye, and you will be up and running in no time using pencils, brushes, layering, and pan/zoom features. This product is going to make it easy for you to \\""sketch\\"" out a rough draft of the artwork you want to create. It will not create a masterpiece probably, but you can certainly move your file into AP and tweek your art to your heart's content.<br /><br />This product was easy for me to install, and it has never appeared sluggish to me when using it. I suppose the only problem I had with the product is its name. I think of the word \\""sketch\\"" as being a drawing. Thus at first I thought this was a drawing program. So don't be confused by the name. What you will get with this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one. And if you are already expert I suspect you will thoroughly enjoy this product to create the early-goings of a paint file you will fine tune in AP. 5 stars!this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one.

The only thing that truly binds me to OS X is that it is much more stable than OS 9.

The software itself is rather complex but it is very simple to use. Logging foods and exercise is very easy and quick. It even helps you track your water intake based on demands from food and exercise. It helps track the nutrition in what you are eating so you have visibility to how much vitamins you intake and where you might be lacking throughout the day. This is great software.

Norton 360 5.0 Sop 10 User,Software,1,0,0,N,N,Does not work!,"Norton doesn't work and you will be expected to pay $99 to get Customer Support when the program fails. I am very computer literate and relied on Norton to protect my computer from viruses and malware. I am quite competent at avoiding threats, but there are some that even the most experienced user can't prevent. Their program did not catch an old \\""virus\\"" (technically malware) that has been out for a long time, so it wasn't an unavoidable problem.<br /><br />When I contacted customer support for help removing the program Norton didn't catch, they tried to charge me $99 to correct their mistake before they would even discuss the problem (either do it yourself or pay $99). I spent over 4 hours working with inexperienced techs that did not have adequate computer knowledge trying to get the problem fixed. The \\""Customer Service\\"" agent deleted at least one unrelated program from my computer (was not infected) that I will have to pay to replace. I will now have to spend my time trying to figure out how to totally remove the malware from my computer as it seems to be in the registry and affecting my computer after Norton's software claimed it was quarantined (it took 4 hours and 3 techs to even get that far on top of the multiple scans I had run). I will likely have to pay someone to work on my computer to ensure that my computer is safe and pay for new antivirus software. My computer is nearly unusable.<br /><br />Bottom line, Windows 7 has great antivirus software built in (you do have to find it and turn it on) or you can use a number of free options that work as well or better than Norton. It has been years since I've tried Mcafee so I can't comment on it's effectiveness. Do not depend on Norton even if you are computer literate.

If you want a real Photo editor program one that will grow with you once you have learn the basic then this is the program to get but if you looking for something that will do all the work for you and you are happy with the results from auto everything then don't get this program stick with the Windows base Photo program.

ACT! 2005 [Old Version],Software,2,7,9,N,N,Too many bugs,"My problems began with installation. <br /> <br />1.) File was corrupted upon loading the software from the CD. Went to ACT website, they had the file available (not a unique problem, obviously), and I was then able to load. <br /> <br />2.) I then had problems converting data from ACT! 6.0. Went to ACT website again, only solution was to uninstall and reinstall. I also shut down Spybot, which may have corrupted the first loading. They tell you to shut down Anti-Virus software, which I did, but not Spybot. Data converted after doing this. <br /> <br />3.) I have NO custom fields, but data from my Salutation field did not convert. All fields blank. Since I had converted to ACT! 6.0 from a previous customer manager, this meant I lost all my contact first names, and this was the deal-breaker. I may have been able to get through this, but see 4.). <br /> <br />4.) I did not notice item three for several hours, and used the program during that time. As previous reviewers have noted, it is noticably slower than ACT! 6.0. It also slows down the rest of one's computer, reboot is slower, etc. I also started having problems with MS Outlook crashing, which had never happened before. <br /> <br />All things considered, I decided to return the software, and stick with ACT! 6.0, at least for a year or so while they figure things out. ACT chose to go with a more complex platform, which may help them with their corporate accounts, but is more problematic for smaller users. Computer speed will continue to be an issue. Also, you cannot synch with other users with Windows XP any longer. You must upgrade to Windows Professional. <br /> <br />I found ACT! (Best Software) to be good about trying to make things work, and allowing me to return the software. Their support group surpasses their product development group. If you are dying to try ACT! 2005, either wait a few months while they fix a few things, or be prepared for a tedious conversion process and slowerperformance.

NTI Backup Now 5 Advanced Edition DVD Case,Software,3,1,1,N,N,Unfair Reviews,"I was surprised to see that NTI Backup Now 5.5 advanced has such low ratings, so I came here to read the reviews. I see two different 1 star reviews from people who say nothing about its backup/restore performance, and instead complain about their installation issues.<br /><br />I am no expert in this area. All I can say is that I chose NTI 5.5 Advanced because I needed a program that wouldn't balk at backing up OPEN FILES. And so far, 5.5 seems to be doing that just fine. So far I have not had a need to restore any backups, so I am reluctant to give this product my full endorsement until I've seen whether it restores properly. So I'm going to give it three stars for now.<br /><br />But come on people, just because you're having install issues, don't automatically assume its NTI's fault.

Chess Tactics ART 3.0,Software,3,10,10,N,N,not up to my expectations,"In this review, I consider 3 points<br /><br />1) organization and difficulty of the material<br />2) interface<br />3) software vs book (M. Block \\""The art of combination in chess\\"")<br /><br />1) The soft is marketed to players with elo up to 2300. At the same time, the material is classified according to tactical and geometric motives. This has both pros and cons, and IMHO suits better to beginners and lower itermediates rather than to more advanced intermediates and experts. A book cannot be organized both ways; a software certainly makes it possible, but no such feature (e.g. @show a random position with a difficulty between 50 to 120) exists in CT-ART (even in the test mode, the topic is still shown in the upper bar).<br /><br />The difficulty varies dramatically throughout the course. Comparing with well known Konotop series of tests in chess tactics, difficulty level of 10 should belong to \\""test for beginners\\"" (ca 800-1200 elo), while problems with difficulty above 110 would probably be found in \\""tests for candidate masters\\"" (2000 FIDE Elo and above).<br /><br />2) interface: fair to poor. First of all, if you have windows Vista you need to know a thing or two about the interactions of this soft with your OS. Convecta recommends turning the UCA off, which is plain ridiculous, because ct-art also works fine (if it ever works fine) when you install it in a separate folder outside your \\""program files\\"" folder. Secondly, I never succeeded in making the pieces move faster and the intervals shorter (the pieces move extremely slow. If the problem is easy I nearly fall asleep). Theoretically you can control the speed and the interval, but in practice the soft doesnt respond: thisngs move the same slow way whatever speed you set. If you make a mistake, the program displays a refutation if it typed in. Otherwise, it shows a \\""prompt\\"" using ridiculous blinking markers. I had to quit the excersise and restart it each time I made a mistake. You CAN turn them off though, this option does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART? The very selection of the problems. I do find it excellent, it teaches precision and consideration of all tactical motives in each position. But: here the soft and the book are nearly identical. What is bad in CT-ART? Basically, everything else. Poor interface. ridiculous ratings that have nothing to do with the reality. In many positions there are several ways to win, but the program gives you a penalty (tipically, the first move is unique, but on later stages.... Once I got a penalty for correctly executed checkmate in one!). On the other hand, when solving a difficult problem (90+) I happened to fail to find the principle ideas, but still collect 60% of points for that problem! Conclusion: I quit the soft and got the book.<br /><br />UDP: Now CT-ART is already available with the new Peshk@ interface. As far as I was told, the interface issues have been resolved.<br /><br />Hope this hepls.<br />AVoption does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART?

Mac OS X Snow Leopard Family Pack (5-User),Software,1,4,16,N,N,Snow Leopard is NOT ready for prime-time. Do NOT upgrade!,"In short: Snow Leopard (SL) feels like a Beta release. It is NOT ready for prime-time. This honestly feels like the release of Microsoft Me (Millenium edition, remember when MS put out that garbage as an \\""upgrade\\"" to '98?). SL is THAT bad. Details: With every update to OS X you hear the stories of third-party apps not being compatible and causing issues. Understandable, given the limitations of some (especially smaller) developers. In my case, the apps in question are Apple's own Mail and iTunes. Specifically, Mail would lock while trying to download new mail. The update circle/arrow next to each email address would spin all day. Meanwhile, the same mail came through just fine on my wife's MacBook Pro (running 10.5.8). iTunes would at some point (while sitting idle all day while I'm off at work) inform me that my iTunes library could not be found and the pop-up error messages (one for each of the thousands of items in my iTunes library) could not be Force Quit. After rebooting, everything would work fine for a while. This is why I switched to a Mac. To avoid this exact issue (rebooting multiple times a day just to do the basics). I upgraded my iMac (just over a year old, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4) to SL on 9/3 and gave it a week to sort out any issues. Last night I threw in the towel and reverted back to Leopard (this is why you MUST create a cloned copy of your hard drive before you upgrade (use Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner and create a bootable drive (and test it! (hold down the Option key while you reboot)) before you do any OS upgrade (PC or Mac))). Time Machine couldn't save me. It told me I was out of disk space (I wasn't). I know all the great features Apple put into SL (which I why I upgraded so early in the life-cycle) and was loving them (smart disk eject, click and hold on an app in the Dock and see all the occurences of that app, super fast boot times, etc). But until the bugs get fixed, I don't dare go near Microsoft Me - sorry,I meant Snow Leopard - again. Apple, shame on you for putting out this garbage as a gold master. You were a month ahead of schedule and still rushed the QA. And it shows. No longer will I be able to say \\""get a Mac, it just works\\"". I've put many friends into Macs over the years.

"Fluenz French 1+2+3+4+5 for Mac, PC, iPhone, iPad & Android Phones, Version 3",Software,5,1,1,N,Y,excellent language learning tool,"I have a general working knowledge of several languages - studied in high school and college and through living and working in various countries - but have never formally studied French and knew very little of it. I've been looking for years for a suitable program for it but have always shied away from the \\""total immersion\\"" approach of Rosetta Stone. From my, albeit limited, exposure to Rosetta, it seems that their lessons leave too many unsolved questions about what's going on. To follow them, you'd really need to equip yourself with a grammar book and dictionary and be prepared to dig for lots of explanations the lessons don't supply.<br /><br />The theory behind an immersion program seems to be that little children learn languages much better than adults, so we should try to mimic that experience with adults. The trouble is that adults don't learn as little children do - and as the Fluenz creators recognize, that's both a plus and a minus. It's a disadvantage in that adults will most likely never master a language quite as deeply as a child. An English-speaking adult who learns French, for example,will never be able to speak French without at least a trace of an English accent. But having learned English thoroughly before learning French is also a huge advantage! English speaking adults can leverage their existing knowledge of how a language (English) works to learn the target language. As adult English speakers, we already understand the many forms we need a verb to take: for I, you, s/he, we, they. So when we learn the \\""I\\"" form, we look for the \\""he\\"" form and etc. Because of the knowledge we have of what we don't know, we make much more rapid progress in the target language than a child could.<br /><br />But. We can do so only if we are given explanations that correspond to the questions we naturally have. For a simple example: we naturally wonder, why do you say you are going \\""en France\\"" but \\""a Paris\\""? It's unnecessarily frustrating if the language program youuse never bothers to provide you with the simple explanation that you always use \\""a\\"" when you are going to a city but not necessarily to a country.<br /><br />Each Fluenz lesson begins with a short intro, then goes to a dialogue which provides information and vocabulary relevant to tourists. Each lesson develops and expands upon the grammar introduced in the previous lessons. Because most people traveling to Francophone countries will be interested in getting the basics down, lessons often center on being in a cafe and ordering food, or with traveling from place to place or asking questions at a hotel. These short dialogues can be listened to with no subtitles, with subtitles only in French, and with subtitles in English and French. After the student has listened to the dialogue, the instructor comes on and goes through what the student has just heard, line by line, adding additional relevant information as well as mnemonic devices to help students retain the information. The instructor also adds related concepts or structures to those introduced in the dialogue. Subsequent \\""workouts\\"" encourage students to practice through reading, writing, listening and speaking. What I find particularly delightful are the little comments the instructor sprinkles in along the way about some element from film or sports or culture. Once, the instructor mentioned that the bidet was \\""one of France's great gifts to womankind.\\"" I doubt I'll ever forget that line as it was so unexpected and human a remark.<br /><br />As much as I love this program, I would have given it 4.75 stars rather than 5 if that were possible because the software is just a bit glitchy. You have to play around with it in order to get it to work properly. For example, you might, in a given workout, get just one question and find, when you hit \\""next\\"" that the workout seems to be done. There is no way to move forward within it. What you need to do in that case is select \\""next workout\\"" and then go back - and backwards -until you complete the previous workout. It took a while for me to realize this, so I missed some valuable practice along the way.<br /><br />Overall, Fluenz is an excellent program, long overdue. I look forward to learning my next language with Fluenz.",6/13/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

TurboTax Deluxe Fed + Efile + State,Software,1,19,19,N,N,The Arrogance of this TurboTax VP Sold Me H&R Block,"I have been a TurboTax users for years (cannot remember how many but around 10). When looking for TT Home & Business to buy this year, I stumbled upon these customer reviews. I also learned that I can purchase TurboTax Home & Business from Costco for $65 after their discount and thought about buying it because ultimately, I plan on buying Home & Business anyway. I then continued reading on and found so many arrogant and ridiculous replies from the VP that I decided to look for the H&R Block option as recommended by many here. Then luckily I found a way to purchase H&R Block Premium including one State download for only $14.95 plus tax. I even called H&R Block to confirm that I do not even need their Premium & Business for my specific case which will require Home & Business from TurboTax. By the way, H&R Block Deluxe can be purchased for only $4.95 but will be $9.95 if a State is needed. Just google \\""HR Block Deluxe for $4.95\\"" and find out how to do this.

The Invincible Iron Man: The Complete Collection,Software,5,2,2,N,Y,Amazing value at the original price,"This collection consists of actual comic books that have been individually scanned and converted to PDF files. This is one of a number of such collections, all of which were an absolutely amazing value when they were first published, with hundreds of comic books, some dating back to the 1960s, available on a single DVD for one low price. Unfortunately, Marvel Comics refused to continue licensing their content to Git Corp and the collections are no longer available. Today, the DVDs are collector's items, sometimes going for hundreds of dollars. At their original publishing price, this was an incredible deal. At the prices today, when you can even find them, you should definitely think twice.<br /><br />The files are not DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected, so you can copy the PDF files to your computer or laptop, even to your Kindle Fire tablet. You can also create backup DVDs to make sure that your collection always remains accessible. If you view the collections on your computer or laptop, using the Adobe official PDF viewer, everything is fine. If you view the collections on your Kindle Fire tablet, there is a semi-transparent &#34;Marvel&#34; watermark that will show up on every page. I've tried every PDF viewer in the Amazon App Store, including the Adobe PDF app, and they all exhibit this flaw. Once I got used to it, though, it didn't bother me much and it's handy to have a really portable way to read these files.<br /><br />Each file contains one complete comic book, including the front and back covers, all of the advertisements, the letters page, and so on. The files are arranged in two-page spreads, 1100 pixels wide by 850 pixels high. I can reduce these to roughly 75% of full size and still read them. Much below that and the text becomes hard to read and the details are muddy.<br /><br />For the collections that go back to the 60s and 70s, it's both nostalgic and hilarious to read some of the advertisements (Sea Monkeys! X-Ray Specs! Charles Atlas!). The scan quality in those earlier issues is surprisingly good, considering the age of each comic book. These are very readable, in very good condition.<br /><br />This collection begins in 1963 with Tales of Suspense #39 (for 12 cents!) where Iron Man was first introduced. In 1964, in Tales of Suspense #59, Captain America joined Iron Man and the comic title officially became Tales of Suspense featuring Iron Man and Captain America. This continued until 1968, where issue #99 became the final Tales of Suspense issue and each hero subsequently got his own title. The Iron Man title continued through issue 332, in 1996, after which Marvel rebooted the character and restarted the issue numbering. The reboot concluded in 1997 with issue #13, with a second reboot beginning in 1998 and ending in 2004 with issue #89. There was a third reboot in 2005 and the collection concludes with issue #12 of that reboot, in 2006. In addition, the collection contains Annuals 1 through 15, Annuals 1998 through 2001, Giant-Size Iron Man #1 (from 1975), and a detailed Iron Man bio. All told, counting index files, there are 586 files to browse.The scan quality in those earlier issues is surprisingly good, considering the age of each comic book.

I had always been a Turbo user but was so incensed at last years shenanigans by Intuit that I switched to TaxCut (and would do so again, should they initiate the same nonsense as they did in 2002). In any case, TaxCut in not even remotely as user friendly or robust as Turbo and given the opportunity to have Turbo as it was in 2001 and prior I have gladly come back. After reading the reviews on Amazon I hesitated, but am glad I gave it a try. The installation (on a Win 98 machine)was flawless (except for a minor glitch of it crashing my system when updating the software the first time). Useability is as good as always, in my opinion, which as I've said is light years ahead of TaxCut. In light of the options available on the market, Turbo is the clear choice (unless you want to suffer with a lesser product like TaxCut -- which I will grudgingly do again if Intuit plays games like they did in 2002!)",3/14/2004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack (3-User) [Old Version],Software,5,0,0,N,N,Windows 7 Home Premium 3 Pack,"Great price on an awesome OS. When installing on your second and 3rd PC make sure to answer and you call the MS helpline make sure to answer no to installed on multiple PC's and talk to the MS rep, let them know your using the family pack and you should be good to go. I cant say enough good things about Windows 7. Using it on 3 PC's, networking and security is a breeze using home group and related permissions. Can use media center for free OTA DVR recording, and share out recorded TV and family videos for the whole house. I have done a ton of Win7 Installs for friends and family and the great majority of hardware is detected right off the bat. Occasionally you may need to tweak a setting but by far this is the best MS OS to date. Its fun to use and easy to manage and works with alot of software. Pro edition adds Domain logons and XP mode, however most shouldnt need these features and can still use MS Virtual PC or VMware for similar functionality. Media Center is fun to tweak, if you do this with a 15 IR remote you can use your PC isntead of Tivio or other similar PVR/DVR solutions. For most this will save 60-80$ a month on TV costs and when coupled with netflix and Hulu offers up some great programming. We get 60 stations in my city over the air which is more than enough. My kids havent complained one bit and have many new programs they love to watch on PBS and Qubo.<br /><br />Detection of network devices and hardware is a snap. Any Dual core 2Ghz plus machine with 2GB ram runs great, but for the record I have even tested on a 5yr old Latitude D610 with 1.5GB ram and even that system runs fine. Bottom line is this OS is simple enough for a novice and loaded with features for anyone who wants to take advantage of them. Drives a little closer to a Mac but with tons more software applications and flexability. I love runing virtual PC sessions for work and fun and how well it all integrated between Win7 PC's.",11/29/2010,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2008 - 3 User Pack,Software,2,0,0,N,Y,"It had bugs, but they have been fixed","Well, I have had this software installed on an old Dell Windows 2000 machine and on a new home-built Win XP machine based on an Intel motherboard for less than a year. I can not say that I have been too happy with the overall performance of this product, but it seems to be working well now that it has the latest patches. By the way, they don't tell you that their version 8 and higher software does not work with Windows 2000. So if you want to run an old Win 2K matchine, don't go for this software unless you can get the last of the Version 7 software - version 7.0.483.000. I had the same negative experiences that the above reviewers had, but again, they are now corrected. My XP machine does run the latest version 8 software and it seems to be working great. My Win 2K machine has to run version 7.0.483.000. and it does OK. Can't really complain about the Win2K machine as it is so slow anyway and is no longer supported by Microsoft anyway. Regarding the reviewers that gave this software a 5 star rating. I find it hard to believe that these are legitimate reviews. I would actually suspect these reviews as being sales pitches from the Zone Alarm folks. I find that this company is a little questionable in how they deal with their customers and their customer service. I have seen them delete negative comments on their software from their user forums. They have never lied (that I am aware of), but I simply felt that they do their best to put a rosey picture on their product. As one reviewer above noted, their Tech Support put the blame on my other programs when ZA practically brought my XP machine to its knees. I also was told to disable my other programs until I found \\""the culprit\\"". Well I didn't do that. I have those programs on my computer because I want them there. Better that ZA should fix their product, which they eventually did. However, they never simply came out and took the blame for a defective product update. I used to love their freefirewall and this was why I decided to try their full service product. Hopefully these bad experiences were just growing pains that ZA is getting past, but they have damaged their reputation by failing to be completely forthcoming with their customers.

MacSpeech Dictate [Old Version],Software,3,3,5,N,Y,pretty frustrating,"I bought this software for transcribing handwritten documents and interviews (I listened to the interviews and repeated the words into the microphone). Unfortunately, it was almost always faster for me to type because the program makes a LOT of mistakes. My interviews and documents have tons of proper names and uncommon older words in them though, so I think MacSpeech might work better for other kinds of dictations or transcriptions. I also find this program to be extremely buggy. It usually crashes at least once per day, even after I installed the updated version. I used MacSpeech quite a bit because my wrists were getting strain injuries from typing, but I usually just ended up getting really frustrated. Maybe with a lot of effort, I could train MacSpeech to better recognize my voice, but I'm not willing to invest more time than it would take me just to type the transcription in the first place.

I don't need a Deluxe Edition for around $50. That is why I didn't upgrade in 2008, but had no choice in 2009 if I was going to upgrade at all. When I installed Quicken 2009, the program would not run. The Quicken logo flashed on the screen and disappeared. I restarted and reinstalled Quicken. I had the same problem, so I checked what support options I had, as I had never had to contact Intuit support before. I was disappointed, to say the least, that Intuit does not offer free telephone support, but warns of a $25.00 fee. Moreover, Intuit calls you back; you cannot call in directly to get a support agent. So I had to settle for Chat support. I did get the problem resolved, but it took thirty minutes, whereas it would have taken about ten minutes if I had been able to talk to a live person on the phone. It turned out that I did not have the right mapi32.dll. The Chat support agent did pick up this problem pretty quickly, and once the new DLL was installed, Quicken worked. The mapi32.dll problem may not have been Quicken's fault, but I first spent five minutes trying to find troubleshooting help on the Intuit web site, and this solution never came up. I had previously thought that Intuit's help information was the best in the industry. My opinion of Intuit has moderated from 5 stars to 3 stars. Quicken is still probably the best such program around, but 2009 may not be as trouble free as it has been for me over the last ten-plus years.",2/13/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
SMARTSUITE MIL ED 9.8.2,Software,4,1,1,N,N,A great suite of programs - I LOVE that I can use Organizer again!!!!!,"About six months ago, my trusty XP computer that I had used for many years quit working. I knew I didn't want to move to Windows 8 with all the complaints about it not running half the programs I have come to love over the years, so I bought one with Windows 7. I was able to load most of my older and well-liked programs, but was VERY sad that one of my favorite programs of all time wouldn't load - Lotus Organizer. It is, by far, the best program of it's kind ever made!!! I loaded it on my laptop running Vista just so I wouldn't lose all of my contacts or my Christmas Card list, and quit using the daily calendar and to-do functions all together, and started using the crappy alternative in Office. Well, I'm happy to report that I found a version of Organizer that works perfectly in Windows 7 in this suite of programs, and I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />There are a couple of things I wanted to mention for those who have been trying to do the same thing. First, this entire suite loaded on my Acer running 64 bit Windows 7 flawlessly. Word Pro is almost the same as I remember AmiPro from years ago, and Lotus 1-2-3 is SO much better than Excel. However, if you try to upgrade (convert) your .or2 file from Lotus Organizer release 2 like I did, you'll be disappointed that it won't convert, even if you compact it first. I'm not sure why this version 5 won't convert it because it says it should. But, don't give up like I almost did. The way I worked around this was to export the contacts, anniversaries and any other categories in the older version of Organizer as either ansi or ascii text files and then imported them into the respective categories in this newer version. Every file came through flawlessly doing it that way. After a number of months missing my trusty old Organizer, it's back - and just as good as ever!!!",5/25/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Norton Internet Security 2005 - Single User,Software,1,0,1,N,N,NIS - has the most features - but NO backup!!! - and a UI from Hell,"(this review is of the Spyware edition) <br />NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have &lt;256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO) <br /> <br />NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT <br />half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work. <br /> <br />Even after LiveUpdate this week, <br />One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. <br />I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. <br />Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. <br />It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! <br />The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining \\""permitted once\\"" 200 times, no actual info <br /> until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE \\""permitted once\\"" IIRC. <br /> <br />NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either. <br /> <br />Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet. <br />Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated. <br />Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented. <br /> <br />If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either \\""permit all\\"" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no \\""permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80\\"" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick \\""web browser\\"" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category. <br /> <br />After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much. <br /> <br />All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. <br />Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig. <br /> <br />I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price. <br />",5/31/2006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PHP With MYSQL Essential Training,Software,5,1,2,N,N,Excellent way to learn dynamic web development,"Could you imagine being able to write a site like Amazon.com from scratch? Well if you master everything in this title you will have the basic knowledge toward that end. Even though he creates a real contact management system, the theory is similar and you can continue from there. I taught Math and Computer Science professionally, and I bought this tutorial to learn the specifics of putting together a dynamic website using PHP (I'm a Java, VB, SQL, and C/C++ programmer). I may be a bit biased with my background, but this guy is a top notch instructor and speaker. I sat thru the entire course, even though what I was really interested in was the very practical website he sets up at the end. Many of the concepts in php are built on C and Java. Although its not a language that would win any awards from the Computer Science community (extremely loose typing for example), it is EXTREMELY powerful and will make writing web applications faster and easier. The array and string processing functions are nothing short of remarkable, and make it SO much easier for a new programmer to write effective programs. One line of code turns a delimited string into an array, or vice versa. Sure you can do many of those things in C++, but you would have to be an expert programmer. PHP is wonderful. There is also considerable background on SQL/databases. This title is well worth the money, this course in a private college would be well over a grand. He takes you from installing the necessary software to finalizing a website that can be developed into something much larger. If you have even the slightest background in programming you should be fine. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could, because it may require some extra effort for the absolute beginner. If your computer experience consists of web surfing and MS office, depending on your aptitudes you may find it a bit difficult, the same way some people find foreign language or music difficult. Others can start speaking Chinese from a web tutorial. Again it depends on you. I would strongly suggest a pre-requsite of Basic HTML and CSS from free sites such as w3schools (google for others), maybe even a programming tutorial from there. However, the title is very good because many \\""easier\\"" tutorials will leave you feeling dry at the end and you won't really have anything to show for it. With my experience in teaching programming languages to newbies, you may have to devote many hours, pause the video and do some googling to solidify these concepts. Becoming a great programmer needs time, patience, and dedication. Do not expect to simply watch the videos and become and expert. Bring a notebook and take notes, type each example into the text editor. Sometimes he will ask you to complete something that he started, and I would be a bit intimidated if I were totally new to programming. I suggest going through those exercises two or even three times until you completely understand it. Again, consider spending a few hours a day for a month to master this material if you are COMPLETELY new to programming. A professional programmer may pick up php fluency in less than a week. This video would be great in a corporate setting to cross train front end web personnel into programming if they are working on a project. Also, considering how web-centric the world is today, even management and non-technical types would benefit from the intimate understanding of what goes into a dynamic-data driven website(he gets into business analysis of the programming situation). Even if you aren't going to do the programming, understanding this title can help you leverage other resources and help you get the best result. Mr. Skoglund also has an advanced PHP video published[...], I will probably be purchasing that too in the near future. http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Beyond-Basics-Kevin-Skoglund/dp/1596715413/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253132473&sr=1-3",9/16/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Witcher Limited Edition (Large Box),Software,5,7,7,N,N,GAMING AS IT SHOULD BE!,"Were I a member of the gaming Industry right now, I would be shamed to be taught what gaming should look and feel like and how it should be marketed by a small Eastern European company. Who of the multi-billion gaming \\""giants\\"" ever went back to improve a released game? Yet, there you have it: thanks to CDPROJECT gaming as an art-form is still alive and kicking!<br /><br />This was the most awaited fantasy cRPG in the past 3 years. Not only did the original deliver, but even more work has gone into truly improving it.<br />THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAD EVER PLAYED - AND NOW IT IS GORGEOUS!<br /><br />The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in both FABLE and TITAN QUEST as well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!<br /><br />The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.<br /><br />Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.<br />Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to PLANESCAPE. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.<br />Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the DIABLO or the TITAN QUEST abilities systems.<br /><br />So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the atrocious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.<br />Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.<br /><br />Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...<br /><br />Whereas the BALDUR's GATES saga was story-heavy but (by today standards) visually wanting and the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS series was found, well, wanting in all aspects, THE WITCHER is the dream cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - and its current EA bedfellows surely put a stop to such aspirations now. That game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect.<br />A tip of my hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!y hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7/27/2009,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 11 [Old Version],Software,2,22,23,N,N,An overrated program with a lot of potential but a lot of rough edges too,"Pros:<br /><br />1) capable of decent accuracy with modest training, and very good accuracy with more extended training<br />2) can keep up with relatively fast speaking meaning overall excellent speed of text generation<br />3) capacity to train multiple users and work within multiple dialects<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) unreliable, crash prone, and buggy - this program needs major work<br />2) poorly sorted out Windows 7 correction dialog operations (ultra-slow)<br />3) program becomes unstable when microphone is turned off for protracted periods of time, requiring reinitialization and reloading.<br />4) program support is a joke - Nuance has to be the most arrogant software company in the world despite some hard working staffers (yup - worse than Microsoft!)<br /><br />It's almost impossible to be on the Internet or working with the computer and not be aware of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking 11.0. You would think from the relentless advertisement by Nuance that the program never makes a mistake, and allows seamless control of your computer while allowing you to dictate virtually everything. Unfortunately, the hype and promise fall well short of the program's actual functioning.<br /><br />Although quite good accuracy is possible with modest levels of training, and very good accuracy is possible in technical fields with training of technical vocabulary, the program's buggy operation, recurrent vulnerability to crashing, humongous speech files and subsequent painfully slow loading, and very slow correction interface (much lower for some reason on Windows 7 than on Windows XP) spoil an otherwise enjoyable experience badly.<br /><br />Although I am almost totally dependent on the program for professional writing (cranking out roughly 20 single spaced pages a day in a scientific area), I am continually amazed with how many rough edges the program has that Nuance seems to be oblivious to, because they recur from edition to edition. As but a small example of lack of attention to relevant details, the program within Microsoft Word does not use the specialized characters for quotation marks, but uses a generic and plainer character set, instead of the one generated within Microsoft Word. This means that if you want professional looking final product, you have to run a macro to replace their generic quotation marks with the proper special character. Although this is a small issue, it's just an example of so many ways in which the program falls down, and displays its lack of polish. It is amazing that despite five editions of the product which I have used that this issue continues, despite feedback from multiple users.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of loading and speed of operation. With a solid-state drive that gets to the Windows 7 desktop in 20 seconds, it takes 25 seconds to load speech files on NaturallySpeaking 11.0. In other words, an extremely fast hard drive loads a bloated operating system faster than it loads NaturallySpeaking 11.0. I hesitate to think how long it would take somebody to load speech files on the average 250 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. You could go out, mow your lawn, calculate your taxes, then do your email, and come back just in time to start dictating.<br /><br />Well, so what? Once the program is loaded, things should be okay, right? Well this is where again the program falls down. First of all, actually correcting things reveals a major bug in their Windows 7 code around keyboard input within the corrections dialog box. When you bring up the correction dialog box, you can't type characters without generating a long delay before the program somehow incorporates your keyboard input (roughly 10-12 seconds) - this is unacceptable waiting time for entering a couple of characters. Dictating or spelling out words within the correction dialog box produces somewhat snappier results, but is still amazingly slow, (again running this program on an extremely fast processor, with 6 GB of RAM, and one of the fastest 250 GB solid-state drives). It's scary to imagine how slow this program would be on the average system. In fairness, some of it appears to be a Windows 7 incompatibility, because I use the same speech files and the same 11.0 version on a Windows XP system, and had much snappier response from within the corrections dialog box. Of course Nuance advertises that their code is Windows 7 compatible - something got lost in the translation. But again, this suggests that Nuance is more concerned with their advertising than with the program's actual performance. This is a continuing theme - Nuance's grandiosity gets continually in the way of their ability to see any problems with the program (or their support - which is clearly an industry low-water mark).<br /><br />The biggest problem though is what happens when you put the program (at least 11.0 - corrected in 11.5) into Suspend by turning off the microphone- and by the way, you are forced to do this because if you simply tell the program to \\""go to sleep\\"" any sound into the microphone will cause the page to scroll back to where the cursor is (in other words any kind of sound acts as a reinitialization command to the cursor - the logic behind that completely escapes me! So essentially you are forced to suspend microphone input if you want to scroll through your text instead of the program intrusively interfering with this. This is where things get really interesting (after you turn the microphone off). After about 5 min., the program will malfunction (again only in Windows 7 and not in Windows XP for some strange reason) and give you an error code which the program cannot recover from, and thus all this nonsense requires that you basically start from scratch all over again. This means not simply reloading the program, because the program actually doesn't pull itself out of memory reliably and oftentimes leaves a huge executable sitting in the background (taking up over 300 MB of RAM) - - if you don't kill the program this way, when you try to reinitialize it, you will immediately get the same error code. This means you have to bring up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files. This will again take a long period of time - close to 30 seconds with a solid-state drive, A minute and a half with a slow conventional hard drive. All of this nonsense of course significantly deteriorates the productivity advantage associated with dictating versus typing. Indeed, for short pieces of text, all these hassles mean that it is almost always faster to simply type out a couple of paragraphs then it is to struggle with the program. For longer text generation, and assuming that you dictate continuously and don't risk putting the microphone into the off position for any extended period, the program is more productive and faster than typing.<br /><br />This process of recurrent shutdown and reinitializing (due to fatal program errors) can be very frustrating, and oftentimes has to be repeated multiple times, because if you leave the program on (by not turning off the microphone), and there is any background noise you'll get endless junk words into your dictation space. This brings up another striking failure of the program - its total inability to discriminate speech from background sounds and non-speech noises. The program seems to believe that every conceivable sound must translate into a word, and therefore, any kind of background noise makes it impossible to use the program particularly if you are not using a noise canceling microphone, and instead are dictating on a laptop that has a standard integrated microphone. You would think that the program, which runs on an enormous number of laptops, would be optimized for the standard integrated microphones on laptops. Unfortunately, it is not. You have to use Dragon's headphone microphone gear or some equivalent. Curiously, a much earlier version of the program NaturallySpeaking 8.0seem to work much better with laptop microphone arrays. Why this might be is beyond me.<br /><br />Because the program code is buggy and unreliable and subsequently the program locks up, you will find that occasionally your speech files are completely trashed and cannot be repaired through Nuance's repair algorithms (there is a speech file Restore function from within the program). This means you had better make a backup copy of your speech files (make that several backup copies), or you will find yourself having to retrain your user identity all over again, from scratch. Additionally, you will find that their optimization program (which gives you the chance to optimize speech files that have had numerous corrections made to them) is not reliable and also locks up regularly. And BTW, its continual crashing will occasionally damage programs with which it is linked, such as Word and Outlook, requiring re-installation of those as well. In other words, this program does not play nice with your system.<br /><br />In case you're suspicious that these difficulties are unique to my machine, or are a function of viruses, spyware, or other hardware problems, rest assured that none of these issues are remotely responsible for the Programs buggy and unreliable operation. I run two spyware and antivirus programs concurrently, my system is about as fast as a window 7 system can be (Windows experience index 6.7 overall), and I always keep the machine in good working order. Just to clarify, I do tech support for most of my friends on their Windows 7 and Windows XP systems - so the problem isn't that I have a damaged Windows installation that is to blame for these issues.<br /><br />All of these operational headaches spoil what otherwise might be a useful program. I believe that all of this emerges from Nuance having a very grandiose notion about their software, and not really listening very much to end-users. It's a shame that there is no real competition in the PC marketplace when it comes to dictation software. If there was, I suspect Nuance would have to get their act together because they would quickly lose market share. Given all these issues, 2/5 stars is actually generous. I wish I could make do without the program, or transition to another speech recognition platform, but unfortunately I can't.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forget the best part: don't expect Nuance to know anything about any of these issues. They have some of the worst technical support I have ever seen in the industry. They blame your system and your computer and claim there are no deficiencies in their program(!).<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Dragon 11.5 has just been released and after several weeks - I can see that Nuance has fixed some things, but not touched many others. It no longer crashes as frequently, or generates bizarre error codes as frequently, requiring that it has to be re-initialized regularly - although that still happens. It loads somewhat more quickly. However, it continues to interpret every sound as speech, has a painfully slow corrections dialog, and as per the norm, reaching technical support is like trying to call the Dept. of Defense and you don't have technical support past 90 days. It is painfully obvious that Nuance has no real handle on the program's deficiencies, and therefore it is a 2/5 star program.

Powerquest Drive Image 7,Software,5,7,8,N,Y,Works great. Easy to use.,"Works as advertised. I took me 14 mins to create a image of my harddrive to an external firewire drive. The drive had 15 GB of data, and the compressed image was 8.5GB. I wanted to test it to make sure that the product actually works, so I've booted off the included recovery CD, all my controllers were recognized even thou my C: drive is all SCSI and mad up of 3 drives in RAID 0, while the D: drive is a IDE RAID 0 too. The firewire drive was recognized too, so I was able to select the backup image and strat the restore. After 20 min I was able to reboot my newly recovered drive. <br />The only issue I had is that I use a new motherboard that includes the Intel 1000/100BaseT network chip-set, and the PowerQuest recovery disk did not recognize it, so would've not been able to do a restore by using a network stored image. However this should not be a issue since in the online manual there is information on how to load drivers at boot time, I haven't used the procedure for now.<br />On more thing, this product is extremlly easy to use.

I just spent over an hour trying to CHAT my way to resolution on a very basic problem that is inexplicably gob-smacking for them. Here is what happened: My bank changed their log in system and made me select a new username and password. Once I did that, I attempted to update Quicken, but now it won't connect to that bank. Something in the Quicken software doesn't like the change and though I can log in to the bank through a web browser just fine, in Quicken it won't work. Now I have to wait 3-5 days for some advanced department to review my log files and get back to me.

A novice user would not know that other hidden partitions exist on their computer and would probably not backup them. If the purpose of Ghost 14 is to backup an entire computer then the user should see all partitions that exist on their hard disks as the default configuration. Let the user hide any partition as an option since I know hidden partitions are important too. If your hard disk fails you do want everything back including the hidden partitions. In my opinion the menu configurations of Ghost 14 are more complicated than what it needs to be for the average user. Gone are the days of Ghost 2003 when Symantec would allow a home user to backup all his computers at home with a single copy of Ghost. Now we must all purchase one license of Ghost per PC. The only Reason I purchased Ghost 14 was because DELL messed up their bios on my new laptop so Ghost 2003 would not work with their USB ports. Ghost 2003 would allow you to create your own boot CD disks if you knew how to create boot CD disks with Nero and knew how to modify batch files. You were able to boot Ghost from a CD and backup your entire computer to an external/internal drive or burn a CD or DVD backup. Ghost 2003 is still able to backup all my other computers with Windows Vista and Windows XP (32bit and 64bit versions). The Ghost 14 bootable CD only restores images and does not have any backup software available so it behaves like a rescue CD. All backups in Ghosts 14 are conveniently done when logged in to a Windows XP or Windows Vista account unlike Ghost 2003 which requires you to use a bootable CD, USB Drive, or floppy disks.",10/12/2008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac [OLD VERSION],Software,5,0,0,N,N,"Paralles 4.0 over Fusion, Virtual Box, and Crossover","First off, I am here to testify that Parallels 4.0 is the best solution to running Windows apps on Mac OS X. I have tried Crossover (Crossover Games too), VMWare Fusion 2.0, and Sun's Virtual Box. Crossover([...]) is a good solution if you just want to run one windows app but anymore and it becomes a really big headache (if are not a computer engineer/programer). Virtual Box ([...]) is great if you like free stuff but again same thing with Crossover, if you are not a computer engineer/programmer it's a very difficult application. VMWare Fusion 2.0 (http://www.amazon.com/Smith-Micro-Software-Inc-VMFM20BX2/dp/B001F5VBRU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=software&qid=1252022776&sr=8-1)is great to run Windows apps but can be slow at times. I first bought Fusion about a month ago. I have been reviewing all of these products since I bought my Macbook Air, yes I said Air, in January 2009: these are my results. I tried VMWare first because at that time it had the best reviews. These are the operating systems I have used on VMWare Fusion 2.0 and Virtual Box: Linux Ubuntu 9.04, Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate (32-bit RC), and Sun Open Solaris 10. VMWare doesn't work with Open Solaris very well (I haven't tried Open Solaris with Paralles yet), in Virtual Box Open Solaris worked pretty good. I say this up front Windows XP works great with all three virtual machines, not a problem. Windows 7 does not work in Virtual Box, period but works in VMWare Fusion 2.0 very slow. Windows 7 runs great under Paralles. Crossover doesn't even support anything past Windows XP. Ubuntu 9.04 worked pretty well with VMWare Fusion and Virtual Box (again, haven't tried Paralles yet). The biggest issue I found with Virtual Box is the fact that wireless internet is not useable in the guest machine nor does shared folders work at all (on any of the OS's). The biggest issue with VMWare Fusion is friendliness, Paralles just looks much better and again just works without issues. Overall, I rate this product to be the best of the best virtual machines out there to date. NOTE: IF YOU WANT A PRODUCT THAT JUST WORKS GO WITH PARALLES 4.0.

Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer Suite 7.0 [OLD VERSION],Software,3,109,115,N,Y,Know What the Program is NOT Before You Buy,"I think this can be a fun suite of programs if you like to speculate about how a new project in your house or yard might turn out. A reasonable library of materials and a relatively simple design process allow you to create rough approximations. <br /> <br />There are software limitations, however, that will frustrate perfectionists. Design angles are limited to 7.5 degree increments, for instance, so getting the exact angle of your hedge, angled sidewalk, or slanted driveway may not be possible if that angle isn't divisible by 7.5 degrees. <br /> <br />Another example of limitations is that the roofing application makes no provision for certain circumstances in which two sections of roof have different slopes. The result is that you can't really recreate the roof on an L-shaped house unless the two branches of the L are the same width. I thought this was a user error until I found that the tech support solution was to widen the thinner section of the house to get the roof to line up right. <br /> <br />In short, the program is not going to provide architectural specs for a house or a reliable blueprint for landscaping your yard. Perfectionists will have to just \\""let it go\\"" after a certain point. That having been said, the software IS fun if you are the sort of person who enjoys design software. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",12/26/2006,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Quicken 2008 Premier [OLD VERSION],Software,1,11,11,N,N,Downgrade from 5-star to 1-star!,"(This is a drastically revised review. My initial installation experience was good, and I rated the program 5 stars. Now I rate it at 1-star.) Here's the recap.<br /><br />I dreaded the upgrade from Quicken 2005 to 2008. I waited as long as possible, then validated my data, etc., and set aside a day when I thought I could stand the frustration. Whaddaya know, the installation went pretty easily, and soon I was up and running, intact, or so I thought. I use Quicken BillPay and have for years, and I have Windows XP Pro. My online billing proceeded normally, and I was greatly relieved. I even submitted a 5-star review. The program does little more than Quicken 2005 did, but the new eye-candy was pleasant, and the upgrade was mandatory. By waiting as long as possible to install, the program was already on Version 7 (God help early adopters!)<br /><br />Then I noticed that my checking account appeared as \\""Wachovia Securities\\"" when the correct account was and always has been \\""Wells Fargo\\"". I tried all the obvious ways to fix it, and nothing worked, so I thought I'd give the new \\""chat\\"" support a try. When it became clear that the things the support person suggested wouldn't work, she simply disconnected!! That solved HER problem. And I decided not to sweat it, since the erroneous name didn't seem to cause any other problems.<br /><br />But then -- I pulled up an old saved report from Q2005, and one column of data was garbage. This time I tried email support. Through an exchange of emails, they advised me to validate the file, and if that didn't work, to supervalidate it. I did all of that (very carefully, I had a backup, but by the way the normal backup you get is worthless, more on that), and it still didn't work. The email guy said I should phone in and talk to a support person.<br /><br />AND THEN I noticed that the validation process had ELIMINATED ALL RECORD OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OF MY ONLINE PAYEE LIST, which was substantial!! Oh woe. This is when I tried restoring a backup file I'd made the day before. But get this: WHEN QUICKEN 2008 MESSES UP, IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM GOING BACK TO A PREVIOUSLY FUNCTIONAL VERSION. Every old file I \\""restored\\"" now showed the same total absence of online transactions and onlinei payees. Now I did decide to phone in for support.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised: Without a long wait time, I was connected to a young woman in Bangladesh or some other remote location, but she was really really sharp and actually solved the problem. This was not trivial. I had to cancel my online billing setup, validate and revalidate and revalidate the file until no \\""corrected errors\\"" showed up, and then reinstate online billing. We basically took Quicken apart and put it back together again. She also corrected the account so that Wells Fargo showed up instead of Wachovia, although this was separate from the issue that had wiped out my online transactions. As far as the column of garbage in the saved Q2005 report, she said that Q2008 does that sometimes; I should just delete the report and recreate it. All these problems were solved, my online payee list was restored, and at that point, I was charged $24.95 for the call. I tried to argue that Q2008 had created the problem and corrupted my file, but decided to blow it off and just pay and be done with it. I thought my problems were over. Ha.<br /><br />BECAUSE THEN, when I next \\""updated\\"" my online accounts, Quicken Bill Pay downloaded the LAST TWO YEARS OF TRANSACTIONS, roughly 650, along with a few new ones interspersed. The balance in my checking accounted was now -$87,000. That's MINUS $87,000.<br /><br />In the next call to phone support I found out that \\""That's just how it is\\"". I would have to go through the last 2 years of transactions and manually delete the duplicates. (He did tell me to sort the account by \\""most recently entered\\"" instead of by \\""date\\"", so I was able to select groups and delete with only 1-2 clicks per transaction instead of the 4-5 clicks it normally takes to delete a transaction.) At the end of all this, my accounts have been somehow \\""unreconciled\\"" -- all records of the last month's reconciliation have been eliminated. So I'm having to redo that too. I don't actually expect my bank account to balance at the end of all this (How do you carefully and thoughtfully delete duplicate records when you're feeling like !@#%$?) I plan to just enter a fudge factor and forget about it.<br /><br />Here's some learnings: If you're converting from an old version, and you decide to validate the file before you start the conversion, keep rerunning the validation routine until it turns up no more error messages. They don't tell you this, but the sharp woman said that was important. Then you may or may not want to \\""super-validate\\"" which you do by holding down the shift key while you go thru the validation procedure.<br /><br />Then you can pray a lot. If your bank account name comes up wrong, try ignoring it. If your old reports look funny, delete and recreate them. Do anything you can to avoid using the Q2008 version of validation.<br /><br />If you need support, go immediately for the phone support. I talked to 2 people, and both knew what they were doing. The first woman was awesome (except for not telling me the horrors that would happen the next time I ran the online update). The second person, a guy, knew I was, well, screwed, and he tried to be as nice as possible about it. I have used Quicken since 1998, and I will say that support is better than it was a few years ago (not close to the way it was Back in the Day), and they don't charge you unless they solve the problem.

Later, I found that it needed \\""activation\\"". When I very carefully entered the 25 character product key, the program rejected it and refused to activate the program. By the time I got around to this the product was not returnable at Amazon.com and I was forced, by Amazon, to contact Microsoft for a fix.<br /><br />The Microsoft phone number initially offered by Amazon was incorrect. The second number offered by Amazon got through to a dispatcher who issued a service ID and was transferring me to a technical representative. That line was disconnected during the wait. I called Microsoft again with the ID and was told there would be a 19-35 minute wait. I insisted. Eventually, a representative verified that my original product key was valid, even though it wouldn't activate my software. She issued a new product key that worked and which eliminated the assorted problems experienced with the software.<br /><br />If you buy this Microsoft software:<br /><br />1. Failure to activate the software causes strange and unattributed problems.<br /><br />2. ===> BEWARE THAT THE PROVIDED ACTIVATION KEY MAY NOT WORK! <====<br /><br />3.

Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac - Old Version,Software,4,2,2,N,N,Near Perfect With Boop Camp Partition,"I bought Parallels for Mac because of previous problems with other similar program, VM Ware. In all fairness, the VM product was a beta so I should have guessed it would be buggy, but even the non beta version had its fair share of bugs. Although VM Ware loaded XP home without a hitch, using the program was fraught with difficulties. First, it was slow as molasses in January. Im not taking just a little slow, Im talking go to lunch and maybe itll be finished slow. Secondly, it was prone to mouse failure. Although it would recognize my mouse, it was always at least 2 inches off the mark. If I wanted to click a box I finally learned to position my mouse at least 2 inches below the intended button and then click. Finally, VM Ware allows for the import of an existing Boot Camp partition (see below) but the process is slow and one slight misstep spells doom. For the novice, its intimidating. Then I went to Boot Camp, which is Apples built in Windows capable utility. It worked without a hitch but you had to reboot to either OS X or Windows and hold the option key to get a boot menu. Of note, Boot Camp runs Windows natively, that is, at the same speed as a regular Windows machine. Fact is, it runs quicker on a Mac! All you have to do is go to the Boot Camp utility (under Utilities in the HD icon) and it walks you through it. I got Parallels because I was tired of rebooting my computer to get to Windows. I use Quicken 2008 quite a bit and Quicken for Mac really bites so I do have to use Windows. With Parallels I dont have to reboot. How difficult is it to access the Boot Camp partition with Parallels? Well for starters, it takes about as long as reading this sentence. Once you install Windows into Boot Camp you then install Parallels in Mac. Upon opening Parallels the first time itll ask you if you want to import the Boot Camp partition with Windows on it. Click yes and youll get a desktop icon that states My Boot Camp. After afew minutes of tweaking youll have Windows running on your Mac desktop. Of course, its not all fun and games. For example, youll get a warning that your Windows serial number is no longer any good because of significant hardware changes on your computer. Not a problem. I called the Microsoft toll free number and they issued me a new serial number when I told them what happened. Also, until Parallels recognizes and installs your mouse in the window, youll have to revert to the old ALT routine (the underlined Y in Yes means you have to press the Y key to enter the command. Making things weird is that you sometimes have to hit the ALT or CTRL key, sometimes you dont. Go figure). Also, you must learn to read instructions. Your mouse cursor will be stuck in the Parallels window that appears. It will seem you cant get it out of the box. Read the bottom of the box and itll tell you to hit CTRL and ALT to get the cursor out of the box and back to Mac. It you go to full screen mode, youll have to remember to key in ALT and ENTER to access the Mac screen again (it merely minimizes the window that has XP or Vista in it). By the way, the default memory allocated to Parallels is 512 MB. Some may find this a tick slow and you can increase it to half of your available RAM if you desire (I have 4 GB so I could go to 2). I found 512 to be just about right, but Vista will require at least 1 GB. If done properly, Windows will act just as fast in Parallels on Mac as it does in Boot Camp. I could detect no discernible difference, but there are a couple things to remember: 1. If Windows is open in Parallels, shut it down as you would any Windows machine. Shutting it down by closing the window may make it crash. 2. Maximize the window for best performance. If you use the default window size things get really crowded very quickly. 3. Dont think you can get away using a hacked or cloned version of Windows. Parallels demands a serial number before it will load Windows, unless you import it from Boot Camp and then Windows asks for a serial number. Either way, youre out of luck if you attempt to use a fraudulent copy. For the price I paid (about $20 when I bought my Mac) you really cant lose with Parallels. It works as intended and actually runs Windows better than a Windows machine.",6/13/2008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-File + State 2012,Software,3,4,5,Y,N,"mostly the same, but in some ways it's worse","I've used TurboTax to do my taxes for many years, in some years I used TaxCut (or whatever it's called now). I've generally found TT to be slightly better, but not dramatically so, and therefore have in the past recommended that buyers consider price as an important factor in the decision.<br /><br />This year I'm in the position of being able to compare the Deluxe & Premier versions, and so far can comment in detail on the investment-related features, which is where they differ.<br /><br />But first: if you're not familiar with TurboTax -- it really is a good option for preparing your taxes if you are a do-it-yourself person, comfortable with going to the IRS website or other tax info sources to get answers to questions. No, TT will NOT, despite the grand marketing claims, take care of you if you're not quite sure about the rules or are confused about some little tax detail that's not either simple or common.<br /><br />If you aren't very comfortable with figuring out the rules, then you might want to have a tax advisor available who can answer questions and perhaps also review your return before you submit it.<br /><br />Now to this year's program: it mostly looks the same as last year's, and the basic workflow seemed familiar and easy to follow. I do like the fact that you can either follow the easy guided path (EasyGuide) or navigate on your own. The dowload options for W2s and 1099s are comprehensive (you can find lists on the Intuit website), but note that Paychex is apparently (still) not supported.<br /><br />1. If you have tax-exempt dividends from a multi-state muni fund, TT doesn't allow to enter the fraction or amount of the dividend that's from your state (so tax-exempt in your state return). They want you to split the 1099 into two parts, one for your state and one for the others. This is just DUMB. A product that generates $1.5 billion in revenue deserves a bit more care & attention.<br /><br />2. This year you'll start seeing the complexity that the IRS created with the basis reporting on sales of stocks and mutual funds. The problem is that some sales are \\""covered\\"", meaning that the basis has to be reported to the IRS (using your chosen basis method), and others are reported as sales, but basis is your job. I found that sorting through this stuff is mind-bending and error-prone, to a large extent because of the shockingly poor job TurboTax does at helping you work through this. A simple table-type structure where you could quickly enter, review, and correct all the transaction data isn't hard to imagine. But imagine is all you can do because of the horrible interface you'll get in TT. I even went into the Forms interfaces, looking at the imported 1099B and the 8949 and the Cap Gains Worksheet -- unfortunately it's even harder to work with those.<br /><br />3. If you have investment transactions, you should probably cough up the extra money and get the Premier version. With the Deluxe version the security names & transaction descriptions are not downloaded correctly: For example, \\""1000 shares of XYZ\\"" shows up as \\""EXCH to ABC\\"" in my case with a 1099B. (Being cynical, I'm thinking that this is an intentional feature degrade, to \\""persuade\\"" us to buy Premier.) With a 1099Div, the payer name was simply \\""Vanguard\\"", instead of the name of the fund, which is not ideal because you want the name on the return to match the name on the report going to the IRS.<br /><br />That's all I have for now, I'll try to write an update when I'm done with my taxes. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Note (Jan 27):<br />I found another area where TT doesn't handle things well, but it's likely to be quite rare: I have a foreign bank account, which earned interest. I couldn't find an obvious place to enter (foreign) interest not reported on a 1099, so entered it in the 1099 workflow, filling in the required details. I had already generated a Form 1116 because of mutual fund foreign income. However, TT did not add the new data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one.. It only flagged this during the error check, and essentially said \\""you made a mistake, go do the form\\"". Not what I expected.<br /><br />Note (Feb 16):<br />Another funny thing: I downloaded Vanguard brokerage 1099, and it seems that only the first sale (capgain) transaction was imported. I can't tell easily whether this is a Vanguard glitch or a TT glitch. Either way, watch out for stuff like this seems to be the appropriate conclusion.w data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one..

Let it do it's thing before you move on clicking away. I got lucky when my computer had a meltdown and I lost everything. I had a DVD of some of my work to see how it looked on the TV. It was only 11 minutes long and had several video clips with music and some transitions. I imported it from my file menu and used it as I continued working on my project. I re-rendered this project and it rendered very fast since all the parts of the this segment had already been pre-rendered. This gave me the idea to make my full movies with several DVD's like \\""Acts\\"" in a play. I make a few minutes of my show with all the bells and whistles i want and then render that segment on a DVD R/W and do this until my show is finished. My Dad's Vietnam documentary was broke up into 6 different DVD's. I then import all of them and drag and drop them into my timeline and render the entire movie on one single DVD. If any small glitches exist i fix them but keep that to a dull roar! the whole idea is to keep the overall work load down to a minimum - like re-tracking some music or adding a transition etc... and then I render the entire project. My first disk on the documentary is 59 minutes long with lots of music, tons of video i took on my panasonic mini DV with a lot of transitions and effects. Since all of the segments of my disk were all PRE-RENDERED the whole project rendered very fast and did not CRASH!!! and this has worked on other projects for me as well.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 9,Software,1,2,5,N,Y,Ancient CD-ROM-Based Format with Junk Software on It,"I wasted $70 hoping find a simple color filter to put over my pictures. This program has no color filter, no ease of use--all it functions are not right at its surface for total freedom to use right away: Every button you need to use has to be learned--and its particular location discovered, sometimes--by learning where the designer has hid away...Buddy: Anything you need on this program should be on its desktop window, just a cursor move and one click away: all these extra odd, hidden steps just to get the button to you need are deliberate programming hacks designed to cheat the cheaper program of its chance to do the job well enough to say, \\""Job done!\\"" They want you to check in to whether Adobe's $200+ program--3X as expensive as this program--offers the hope you're looking for: paying Adobe more money to make its designers do a more considerate job meeting the customer's expectations: well, it's 2012, Folks, and simple picture editing Apps for tablet-like desktop layer app-button point-and-click accessibility are out there--so we can just forget about caring whether Adobe's designers care whether they are doing a better job with their programs, or not: the old Adobe CD-Rom era is dead! This Adobe program did not put the buttons on the desktop surface layer where we expect them!--So, don't buy it! Don't even bother with a try: These buttons need a desktop fix-it feature--total re-arragiblility of its buttons, so its buttons can be put up on the desktop layer where they belong: all in one place like a tablet does with it's Apps--Adobe's designers should have known make them movable there already--since Apple's I-Pad has been able to do this since mid 2010: I phones and the I Pad have had rotating carousel surfaces since then--if Adobe needed a desktop surface layer with more space.... Adobe also frustrated this product's usability by putting obscure symbols on the buttons: super-snazzy photo technician noise that just confuses the customer who hoped he would instantly know what to do with the program--just with one look--this Adobe's program can't let you re-name these buttons with regular words, so each time the customer goes back to this software, the memory of the user has to do the work of rediscovering how these strangely-symboled buttons worked last time they were used... These experiences with the product are enough to reject it and they are clearly designed to be part of it to get the disappointed customer to want to dump the cheap program for the next level program up in price--Once Adobe suckers you into buying this cheap one: you'll be on the treadmill for guessing if the next more expensive photo-editing program has all the expected feature for 3X the price!--where a reasoning man is hoping for at least 1/3 the defects, after paying 3X as much! But People, these problems are more easily corrected by spending $0 on Adobe!--that's right: Zero Money! Because Microsoft's picture editing interfaces are simpler and get the regular job done with a more pleasant blue-and-white interface--Adobe's interface is all dark grey and black and just an ugly interface to put you off. Adobe doesn't let you fix the problem by giving you the use color-freedom settings: Why? Because freedom with assignability, naming, or color selection lets you tailor all the machines in the world for a simple intelligent interface everybody wants! Allowing the use Adobe's software not just for a trivial picture editing tasks, but for how to come up with the perfect photo editing App: did Instagram just make a Billion dollars? So, the one who copyrights what he gets to try from an ideal Adobe program with button assignability, naming, and color selection customers makes Adobe jealous. The simple remedy to all this in 2012 is to just ignore Adobe altogether! Go straight to the web/internet/cloud: just try the more intuitive picture editing programs: try Picnic or Instagram--use your right to buy-and-try--it's cheaper there and relatively risk free: skip off-line picture editing for your laptop: don't waste your money on an off-line program like this Adobe--you're just paying an Adobe programmer all over again to do what a Microsoft programmer was told to do: keep the good features off the less expensive CD-ROM: Adobe and Microsoft still live in the CD-ROM age...offering to pay a programmer at Adobe to do what a programmer at Microsoft was supposed to do--all over again--won't be getting Adobe to be filling in any of the deficits the Microsoft programmer left intentionally at his bosses command...Adobe does just like Microsoft-->it works towards the next sale this way: Adobe uses a harsh and restrictive policy on your freedom to buy-and-try--that customer right that almost every business everywhere respects: because customers help business get rid of competitors this way--Adobe's \\""Buddy, if you try it: you buy it!\\"" policy is not the way Adobe should talk to a potential money source...but Adobe's arrogance comes from knowing it has trained and conditioned customers to respect the idea that the customer can't ever open the box: Adobe uses this technicality to bring up another topic: the accusation you copied it!--which Adobe uses as an excuse to keep your money: Quite simply, Adobe should make their software un-copiable, and prosecutible by putting identifying marks in the program to stop anybody from copying it: but the real reason you can't buy-and-try it is: were you to try it, you wouldn't even want a copy of it!--it's junk you'd just want to take it back to get your money back!! This Adobe rip-deal hoping for a dumb package-opening decision is just a check-out counter roach motel: your dollars check in, but they don't check out!--once you take it home and open it, this inferior product is yours: This is sharp-practice software sales, which aims to hard-scam customer money under $100 bucks--Rich companies like Adobe assess fools to be able to take a hit for $100 bucks or less!: figuring fools will be back again to see if giving Adobe 3X the money = Adobe will put only 1/3 the design flaws in this time, again--and proving the gullible customer is now ready to accept a $200+ hit--and still have appetitie for more story of this type, for a return for some more sucker bait: Maybe the $500 program has all the stuff!...don't let them put you on this treadmill of gullibility abuse: Use buy-and-try today on the internet before you buy a CD-ROM: 2012 App programs put these boxed CD-ROM programs to shame--in a 'behind-the-times' category.

NX2 is a very solid piece of software, it does what a photographer needs to do, if you are into design than you need Photoshop.

The interface is a bit different if you have used other programs in the past, but many of the shortcuts are close to other ones, that it should not take you long to get up and running.

There were a few times I had to search for an answer (like how to use a jogged wall to create an entry way), but for the most part it was pretty simple.<br />The main gripe I have with this program is the lack of objects. One area that is totally missing is electrical. You can place where lights belong in the house, but there is no objects for electrical outlets, light switches, phone jacks, or cable/Internet connections. I was surprised because I consider these to be major features.<br />The other issue I have with the program is that when you print your layout there is alot of whitespace surrounding your drawing.

Microsoft Streets & Trips 2011 [Old Version],Software,5,4,5,N,Y,2011 STREETS AND MAPS REVIEW,I bought the 2011 Streets and Maps for my wife to use at work. She is a school bus dispatcher for an elementary school district in California. She assigns kids to school buses for the various schools in the district based on their residence address. The district's info technology department has failed to update the district residence map for at least 5 years. Using the old maps a number of students residences could not be located.

Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition [Old Version],Software,2,8,10,N,N,too much time to train it to what you want,"I admit it... I was happy with Windows 98 but then someone stole our computer. The replacement came with Windows XP motto \\""we think you want things this way, so don't try to do what you want, we know best\\"". If you're a newby you might be happy with this approach, but XP has sucked up hours of time trying to be whipped into line so that it does what I want, in the way that I want it.<br />For example: <BR>- it's incompatible with ZoneAlarm firewall. Every time Windows updates, Outlook Express permissions on ZoneAlarm have to be reconfigured or you don't get email. 98 didn't have this problem.<BR>- useful programs that I use on my Start Menu disappear if I don't use them. So items used (say) monthly have to be hunted down, requiring more mouse clicks. This is an irritating functionality.<BR>- the Help function is crippled by comparison to 98, unless you are willing to go onto the internet. With phone-line dial-in, this is irritating.<BR>- there is little guidance on setting up Identities for a new user of identities, and some programs will register and operate under some identities but not under others (unless you buy two copies of the program). This means more mouse clicks, or duplicate configuration.<BR>- it assumes you want all of microsoft's products to operate for you. In truth I want Word and Excel to never ever go on the internet, and I never want HTML or Word files to be my basic email mode. <BR>- it assumes that only Windows Media Player is the soundware of choice.<BR>- it takes a long time to close down, to the point where you assume it has failed to shut down. Advice: don't CTRL ALT DEL. Just wait even longer.<br />Those are the negatives. In sum, XP behaves like a giant bundled amorphous mass, and trying to configure to prevent certain chunks from behaving in an aggressive fashion will take you much time and effort.<br />However it is relatively stable compared with Windows 98, and most of the configuration can be achieved in time. <br />On thesegrounds, and given that 98 is no longer supported, it can be recommended. <br />Martin",4/13/2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One area where the program falls short however is in search ability. I was not able to consistantly have the program find what it should doing various searches of an 8,000 picture plus database. This included searches on file size, file name, and hotword entries which had been made prior to the searches. Using two other programs of the same type and the same picture collection produced perfect results each time. In my opinion this program shows much promise.

Family Tree Maker Platinum [OLD VERSION],Software,4,1,1,Y,N,Great for those discovering your family history,"I've used Family Tree Maker for many years now, as well as ancestry.com. If you find that ancestry.com is a bit cumbersome at times, you should give the software a try. Family Tree Maker isn't a fully polished software application, but it does get the job done and when it comes genealogy it's one of the few choices to complete the job. Deciding between the various versions of Family Tree Maker should be fairly simple as there are few noticeable differences. Every year or two I will buy the newest version simply to get the ancestry.com membership that is included with the software.<br /><br />The Essentials version gives you 1 month of ancestry.com access, the Deluxe gives 3 months and the Platinum 6 months. The platinum also includes some photo software and an additional gift copy, but those are the differences worth noting in my opinion. Using ancestry.com is much more interactive and it has a cleaner interface, but the FTM software provides better importing and exporting features. I tend to find myself working much faster in FTM than I do online.<br /><br />Is the 2012 version worth an upgrade from previous versions? Like I said, I often upgrade simply for the ancestry.com membership that is included. New to 2012 is the Tree Sync, but it wasn't super impressive.

Dragon Naturally Speaking 7 Preferred [Old Version],Software,5,282,284,N,N,Follow These Simple Tips and It'll Work Great!,"I just bought Dragon NaturallySpeaking and I've already had a lot of success with it. If you're considering this product, I'd highly recommend it. Initially, I bought it because I'm a lawyer and do a lot of dictating anyway. But I also like to see the words on the screen, which is why I sometimes prefer to type things myself. I figured that Dragon NaturallySpeaking would be the best of both worlds. So far, it's worked pretty well for me. But keep in mind that the software doesn't work perfectly right out of the box. Based on my brief experience with the product, there are several keys to success. <br />The first is to put in the time doing the voice-recognition training. Unless you teach the software to recognize your voice, it just won't work correctly. There's simply no getting around this. Although it may seem tedious at first, the training will pay off. (Besides, some of the training exercises on the software are very entertaining. For example, you can read President Kennedy's inspiring inaugural address or an excerpt from \\""Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook.\\"") I spent at least an hour or two training the software when it first arrived and, believe me, it was time well spent. After the initial training period, the more you use it the better it gets because it is constantly \\""learning\\"" from its mistakes. As another reviewer has suggested, it probably takes about two months before you'll be really impressed with the product's potential. (But I'm pretty impressed after only a few weeks!)<br />The second is to buy a decent microphone. A lot of reviewers recommend a USB microphone, but an expensive USB model probably isn't necessary. I have an analog microphone (a Plantronics .Audio 90) and it works just fine. This particular model was far less expensive than most USB microphones that I've seen. The key is to find one that will allow you to position the microphone correctly in relation to your mouth. As the instructions tell you, the positioning of the microphone is essential. Frankly, the one that was included with the software just wasn't up to the task. It always seemed to be too close to my mouth and I was getting very poor results. But as soon as I started using the Plantronics, the accuracy of the software improved dramatically. Trust me, you'll be a a lot happier with the software if you spend a few extra bucks on a good microphone.<br />Third, although it may seem counterintuitive, you should always speak quickly and naturally when dictating, rather than one word at a time. For some reason, the software is far more accurate when you do. Of course, this is a two-edged sword. If you're really \\""on a roll,\\"" and speaking quickly, the software is very accurate. On the other hand, when you just want to insert a word here or there, it really isn't. Consequently, I find that you still have to do some mouse movements when editing your documents. So, although Dragon NaturallySpeaking promises virtually hands-free operation of your computer, don't expect miracles, at least not at first.<br />Finally, until you really start to master the product, you should probably use the text editor that's included with the software. It's called \\""DragonPad,\\"" and I've found that the voice recognition is somewhat more accurate when used with this program than it is with, say, Word or Outlook. Don't ask me why. Besides, it's really not that much of a bother. You can simply cut and paste from DragonPad into whatever application you may be using. When you first start using Dragon NaturallySpeaking, the increased accuracy is worth the extra step. You tend to get less frustrated when it's working the way it's supposed to.<br />I hope these tips help. Have fun, and remember that practice makes perfect. (Yes, this review was dictated using Dragon NaturallySpeaking.)",6/14/2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PowerDirector 5,Software,1,9,10,N,Y,BEWARE!,"Tried the trial version & liked it. Especially liked the interface & the ability to add music easily. More importantly, it worked, so I bought the retail version. After spending upwards of 50 hours and a dozen emails to tech support trying to get the retail version to work, I've given up. Burned DVD video quality is extremely poor and, more recently, I can't even get it to import video from my camcorder. Email tech support is curteous, but absolutely usless. Most recently they wanted me to send them a screen shot of a 6 character windows error message that pops up when trying to import video (google \\""PDR.exe\\"" and the first entry will be complaints about this product). I decided my time would be better spent trying to warn other folks about the flaws of PowerDirector. If you're still considering buying this product, please take a few minutes to review comments from other dissapointed customers that are posted on the web. Unless you've got dozens of hours to waste and enjoy throwing away $, I'd suggest that you steer clear of PowerDirector.",9/13/2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Family Tree Maker 2009 Platinum [OLD VERSION],Software,4,31,32,N,N,Great Product; Deceptive Free Subscription!,"I had no intention of purchasing Family Tree Maker 2009 since I was happy with the FTM 16 version I was using. However, when I became aware that it included a free six-month subscription to Ancestry.com when I was currently paying $29.95 per month for that access, the purchase became a no-brainer. [...]. Wrong! When I called to activate the free subscription, I learned that it is only a free six-month subscription to the US Membership Option. To upgrade that \\""free\\"" subscription to the World Edition I need requires me to pay $10 per month for the six-month period. So, I still save $32.21 but nowhere on this site does it say that the free subscription is only to the US option. Nor does it say that on the product box. In fact, the box clearly states that \\""Family Tree Maker Deluxe 2009 comes with six months of free access to Ancestry.com, the world's largest online collection of family history resources\\"". I would still recommend the product. I didn't like it at first because it seemed difficult to navigate. But, extensive usage soon let me gain familiarity and the improvements are substantial. It is definitely an industrial-strength genealogy program with features that are quite advanced when compared to the FTM 16 version I was using. The only area in which I would downgrade it is that report generation is too slow and takes far longer when compared to generating reports with my prior version. I've also noticed some character conversion problems that I'm assuming will be fixed with a version update. My main point, though, is that potential purchasers should be aware that the free six-months of free access is to US records only. World access will require you to pay $10 per month during that six-month period. It should not be that complicated to make that point clear in marketing materials.",1/22/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Microsoft Windows Home Premium 7 English ROW DVD,Software,1,16,19,N,N,Warning,"When I loaded my brand new full version of Windows 7 Home Premium on my brand new Apple iMac (using Boot Camp to partition the drive), the product code did not work. I went on line and found that a lot of other people are having the same problem, but I could not find a solution. Microsoft's help site offered the following explanation for my problem: (1) I didn't enter the code correctly, (2) I was using counterfeit software; or (3) I was trying to use the same software on two different PCs and should buy a new license. IOW, I am either a moron or a thief. So with heavy heart, I sought help from Microsoft by telephone. After spending two days in Microsoft hell talking to reps around the world, I learned that, although the disc and box it came in were labeled \\""Home Premium,\\"" the disc contained Home Basic. Microsoft's proposed solution was to give me a Windows 7 Home Basic product code for me to load Home Basic on my PC and then I could BUY an update to Home Premium. Not a very good solution for a problem that was entirely Microsoft's fault, but I was unwilling to invest any more time or frustration dealing with Microsoft customer service. At one point, a rep had the nerve to tell me that I should not have bought the product from Amazon because it deals in counterfeit goods. Luckily, Amazon actually has a functioning customer service system, and I was able to exchange the defective disk for a new one within minutes and with Amazon paying for shipping coming and going.

PowerDirector 9 Ultra - 64,Software,4,27,28,N,N,"Trial version works, with a few wrinkles","I looked at PowerDirector because I'd been using Adobe Premiere Elements (APE), versions 7 and 8, and have too many crashes and other issues; despite even buying and using a highly spec'd new machine. I used APE since 2009, mostly on AVCHD source. The machine I'm using is a Sony VAIO VPCF1, Intel i7, with Windows 7, 8G RAM, 500G 7200RPM hard drive, external Western Digital eSata drive. I purchased this machine in November 2010, with APE version 8 preloaded. I loaded previous projects created on APE 7, but couldn't get past a fatal crash that would occur outputting to .m2ts. I downloaded the PowerDirector version 9 trial version, keeping in mind the controversial reviews I've read here. Actually, I didn't search for PowerDirector based on Amazon reviews, but on other forum comments around the net recommending this software. On to the details of my PowerDirector experience: Pros: It loads quickly, ready for editing within less than 15 seconds. There are several preview resolutions available, so I could choose a level that works almost seamlessly in real time as I move back and forth along the timeline. Outputting AVCHD output (\\""Production\\"") of my 6 minute video took about 15 minutes. No crashes or hangs whatsoever. Applying video \\""fix\\"" effects can be done over all clips quickly; not available with APE. With PowerDirector, a title can be editted several times after being created. With APE, it's turned into an uneditable video clip after creation. Cons: I had to fiddle a bit to get used to splitting and trimming clips, but in all fairness that's a learning curve problem; not the software's fault. Here APE is a bit more intuitive. Fades out or in took a bit of time to learn how to apply (APE has menu pulldowns). Some transition effects didn't work immediately. Closing the program and re-opening solved the transition issue. (Since PowerDirector loads fast, this workaround to the transitions flakeyness cost less than a minute each of 3-4 times I didit. In the future, I might just tolerate it and maybe reload once after finishing other work.) I found a bug: I had two title effects, at the beginning and the end of my video. Though the title effects look fine while editting, the first title would be missing on the output video file. Workaround: I found on the Cyberlink PowerDirector forum that others fixed this little problem by simply moving the title to another video track. That worked for me. So I was able to create my video with all my titles intact, no crashes. Though there are issues, I was able to overcome all and get my video created. Yesterday I created 30 minute AVCHD video without any problems. So based on this experience, and not trusting APE anymore, I'll go ahead and buy the PowerDirector 9 Ultra64 version.

AutoCAD LT 2002,Software,5,19,22,N,N,Standard for working with pros,"I divide land, design and build tracts, and used AutoCAD LT as the [less costly] industry standard for computer drafting inputs to engineers, architects and surveyors. And while LT 2002 does include a few of the important innovations of AutoCAD 2002, its capabilities are still strictly limited to 2-D drawing. Definition used below time in/out, 1 in to 4 saved = 1/4.<BR>True to form and the army of programmers, support staff and professionals, compatibility is one of the key advantages of LT 2002. It is 100 percent DWG-compatible with AutoCAD 2000-, 2000i-, and 2002-based products, allowing me to open, edit, and exchange drawing files with my engineers, surveyors, blueprint shop and partner in Hawaii. <br />I used successfully the Web publishing tools included, worked, however a bit laborious, time in vs. time saved 1/2. eTransmit, for example, puts drawings you currently have open--with all associated files and x-refs--into a single set so that I could edit the file on another machine. Necessary component of a file is present without the user having to individually select all related files. Users can then post the transmitted set on the Internet and send it as an attachment via e-mail, even while changing ISPs a couple of times. Additional Web publishing enhancements, such as templates and themes, have been improved dramatically and all worked. <br />Associative dimensioning works and time in/out 1/4. If you modify a geometric object in a drawing, associative dimensioning automatically adjusts all dimensions associated with that object. Got rid of the need to manually update or re-create dimensions for changes in geometry. All in all, this is a very useful feature. However, it does make it more difficult for users who have grown accustomed to manually forcing dimensions of objects in their drawings. Saved tons of time on text, the dimensions immediately change. New layer, text, and attribute tools, such as text scaling, the enhanced attribute editor, block attributemanager, layer translator, all work.<br />Tutorials and product support will speed up the two days of required start up traing, very easy to learn, but time intensive in the box) provides step-by-step instructions on all of AutoCAD LT 2002's features using interesting and real-life sample files.",5/13/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security Premium 2013 (5-Devices) [Old Version],Software,2,0,1,N,Y,Slow Start Up,I'm not a skilled technical person but do ok with most technical projects. I've used Trend Micro products in the past without problems. I found this product used up most of my cpu for several minutes when starting up my computers. I loaded it on 3 different home computers with the same results. I tried downloading a fix for an older version of trend software and that seemed to help but still ate up a lot of cpu mem. It appeared to me that it was using most of the cpu mem on start up to run system scans. This might work well on some of the newer computers with a lot of cpu mem but not on on mine. I removed all from my computers and now I'm using Norton 360 which works just fine for me.,4/17/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo Expressions Platinum 5,Software,3,0,0,Y,N,Easy to use but very basic,"Photo Expressions is like the photo organizer For Dummies. It is very simplified and does not require any deep understanding of Photoshop-like tools such as layering and masks. It is extremely simplified. I personally am one of those dummies, and don't like to spend a whole lot of time enhancing. I just crop and maybe adjust exposure and lighting effects. The software itself was easy to install, but now with iPhoto and Picasa from Google I want to simplify my options. There isn't enough features that would warrant me to use this any more than the stuff I can get for free. If you re the creative type and like to print your own CD labels, greeting cards, scrapbooking, then this might be for you. It reminds of the original Print Shop software. I would probably recommend this for the beginner as the interface makes it easy to use, and once you get more comfortable, you could upgrade to a more powerful program for editing and use the freeware for online albums.",5/23/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This application is diseased with problems in spacing, indentation, tabs, bullets, numbering, and anything else that may be imported from Word or applied within this program. The MS Word export function flat-out CRASHED my MSWord XP Professional, and anything imported from Word ended up with a mind of its own once it hit Business Plan Pro. So here I am with a nice, tidy little business plan -- but I have to completely re-do it in Word and Excel or look like an idiot when I hand it out in presentations. <br /> <br />As much as I appreciate this product's ability to walk one through a business plan, what good is the plan if it is irreversibly locked into an ugly, inconsistent, un-fixable format for printing?",3/22/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a workaround by right clicking, bringing up Properties, and changing the item name in the Properties window. However, it seems reasonable to expect the Item/Rename function to work properly since this is such a common operation. Also, in my case although the Scan button was not grayed out, it was inoperable. A Web search suggested this may be due to improper registration of the application in Windows 8 and that execution of the Nuance scanner connection tool might resolve the problem. In fact it did.

Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4,Software,4,17,18,N,N,"Lighroom 4 will make you look like a Pro, and great noise reduction.","I had avoided buying Lightroom (LR) for many reasons before, mainly because I have a full blown version of Photoshop 5.5 extended (PS) and also the Nikon ViewNX (RAW converter) was free and pretty good. So if you are a person looking for reason to upgrade from Lightroom 3 to 4, then this review is not for you. I have no clue what Lightroom 3 has missing or what is new compare to this. I will review this base on first timers for Lightroom and people with experience with PS and ViewNX and some corel paint 8 (which I own too). I also use RAW, not jpeg editing.<br /><br />Wow is the first thing I got to say after 2 weeks of usage. Actually, after one day I was ready to return it since I can do everything on here between ViewNX and PS. What I didn't realized later is how much faster I can do adjust things in LR rather than convert it in ViewNX raw to jpeg and then edit it in PS (either jpeg or through Adobe Bridge, ACR). Here are the plus and minus of Lightroom 4 version the other photo editors:<br /><br />Pluses:<br />+work flow is fast. View NX is now 64bit like lightroom 4, but LR is a tad faster in term of editing and converting raw to jpg. Editing is not as fast as PS, but PS only open up one photo at the time and that is actually done in another software call Adobe Bridge. I learned from ViewNX not to put more than 100 raw files in one folder, or it will crash. So far no crashes on LR4.<br />+I always found Adobe converter Raw (ACR) clunky to use. LR4 adjustments are easy and fun to use. I can open a before and after views side by side and see how things changed, and not from memory.<br />+Noise reduction is amazing, why buy noise ninja, when LR4 does a great job. I don't shoot over 6400iso that much so, I not talking about that level of noise, just small touch up to clean a portrait skin on the fly. ViewNX has no noise reduction or softener. PS5.5 does, but you can do that in a few ways using filter: de-noise and blurring, there might be other ways too.<br />+Saving presets is something I love. ViewNX comes and can read the Camera raw presets (on camera picture profile), but you can't save any of your own. You can do this in PS as action.<br />+I can do about 90% of editing on LR4 compare to what I can do on PS 5.5e. ViewNX can do about 30-40% of what I can do in LR4. I also have a Sony nex so it raw software is even less useful. More in line with opening files from Adobe Bridge and then editing one by one to ACR, but with the level of option of ViewNX (not as much).<br />+No layering (a good and bad thing) here, to do the same option in Photoshop, I can do in LR4 in 25% of the time. To doge and burn I use the paintbrush and adjust the brightness or whatever and it is done and another one for darkness. In PS you have to create 2 other layers, then name them and turn them into overlay. TO adjust the brushes later, you just touch on the dot. Creating mono/duotone is also easier and quicker. Ex: the slider on the right side you can adjust hue, saturation, luminance, buy just looking and siding the bar. In PS those are separate window you pull from the tab, or you can open those tab to the right, basically it is just easier to use on LR.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />-Won't let me save my catalog library on my network server, it must be saved on the computer HD. You can work with raw files on the network server fine. While having the library running off the computer hard-drive is faster, but I used 2 computer at home and sometime I do editing on either one, so the ability of using the file library on 2 computers with lightroom is not an option.<br />-To edit a photo you must bring it into your library also. You don't have to do this with ViewNX or Adobe Bridge to PS. You can open any file anywhere and start editing.<br />-No layering means no HDR or photo merge. Last I checked HDR and panorama are type of photography, well you can't do it here like you can on PS. Also without layering you can't cut and paste and do motion blur. People who do heavy portrait will still use PS for heavy photo adjustment. The Paintbrush on LR4 only adjusts color, hue, etc, but you can't paint color, line on it like in PS.<br />-Lightroom catalog takes quite a bit of space on the computer hard-drive itself (already 2gigs and I had this for like 2 weeks), something ViewNX or Photoshop doesn't really do.<br /><br />Neutrals:<br />*LR4 was touting its highlight and shadow is improved, I think it is good, but I have been doing this on ViewNX and also PS for a while.<br />*can't read Nikon color profile. I adjust my RAW setting on my [[ASIN:B0042X9LC4 Nikon D7000]] and ViewNX will read those adjustments and when I convert to jpeg it is fast. I don't need to look and edit every files.<br />*Book, Slide show, Print tabs are features I wouldn't use that much and don't care too much. I might be interested in the web tab as I might create my own photography website and do have dreamweaver, so this LR4 features might be useful later on.<br />*there are only 4 tools, but they are more powerful then you thing.<br /><br />Is LR a better RAW converter then Nikon own ViewNX? I would say yes and no. Since LR can do a lot more the potential of a greater picture is there. ViewNX does more natural looking image that I haven't created presents to match yet in LR. It can't do noise reduction, which I am using a lot now on LR. ViewNX still does great straight from the camera shoots better, since it read my in-camera raw presents.<br /><br />I am PC person since I own too many software that don't run on Mac, mostly 3d and CAD software for architecture are PC only. But I got to thank [[ASIN:B002I0JKSS Aperture 3]] pricing; no way on earth is LR worth 300 bucks. It is not a full feature software like PS, even if it is faster for workflow. I wanted LR so long and now the price is about right I would recommend it for all the serious photographers. The only true other option might be [[ASIN:B005MMMT6E Adobe Photoshop Elements 10]] which is a gimp version (most features most users won't even notices) of PS and is relatively cheap.

PC-cillin got rid of the most deadly virus immediately after it was installed <br />on my computer, and without even waiting to update its anti-virus database - simply amazing!<br />For about six months my computer was getting sluggish. I suspected it was troubled by virus but, <br />although I updated my Norton Anti-Virus everyday and scanned the entire computer many times over, <br />Norton declared that it found no virus. <br />Then, one day I started using the Bluetooth wireless dial-up modem kit, but the internet connection <br />got disconnected repeatedly. Each time a note would appear on the screen warning that the computer <br />would restart in 60 seconds. I finally contacted the Zoom modem tech support, and the technician <br />immediately identified the problem; my computer was plagued by the Blaster.Worm virus. Now, I was <br />prepared to forgo using the bluetooth gadgets, but to be plagued by the deadly Blaster.Worm got me <br />very concerned.<br />I re-installed Norton, updated it, and rescanned the entire computer many times, thinking that with <br />this fine-tooth comb scanning, NAV might get rid of the Blaster.Worm. Not only Norton Anti Virus <br />couldn't do anything, but Norton publish a big splash on the website with a long lecture on how <br />deadly the Blaster.Worm is. Also, from then on, every time I scanned, a Norton note would appear <br />on my screen, proclaiming that:<br />1. It cannot delete the Blaster<BR>2. It cannot quarantine it.<BR>3. It cannot repair it.<br />Now, what use is an anti-virus software that boasts of its superiority but is unable to help you <br />when you need help desparately? <br />I also tried two other anti-virus software but to no avail. <br />Then, thanks to Amazon for this customer review feature, I chanced upon this web page on PC-cillin <br />and read some encouraging reviews.<br />I immediately ordered the PC-cilling from Amazon, and it arrived at my door step in less than 48 <br />hours! The amazing Amazon! I had opted for free delivery, which was estimated at 7 days, but the <br />quick free delivery was a pleasant surprise.<br />PC-cillin detected and killed the Blaster.Worm plus a few other viruses the moment it was <br />installed.

CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 [OLD VERSION],Software,5,1,2,Y,N,"If you don't want or can't afford an Adobe Suite, get this!","Very powerful and capable software that runs a close second to Adobe's various Creative Suites. If you don't want to pay hundreds more for an Adobe Creative Suite or you don't need to share files with other professional digital graphic or video artists, then CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 is the way to go.<br /><br />Since the early days of computer software, Adobe and CorelDRAW ran neck and neck for the top graphic design and image editing programs. Since the turn of the millenium, Adobe edged forward and has since sat atop all design, photo, and video software programs. With more acceptance and praise also came a higher price tag.... much higher.... 3-5x times higher.<br /><br />For all of us coveting an Adobe Creative Suite, there is an alternative that works just as well and has many faithful devotees - it's CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5. In CorelDRAW Premium Suite X5 you can do nearly everything that Adobe CS can do and in most cases just as well or better. The capabilities of both software programs are nearly identical - the important difference being the restricted access to file types. Adobe's video and graphic file types have become the professional design industry standard over the years. This is the biggest thorn in the side for CorelDRAW users. To avoid downtime and technical setbacks, it is vital that designers sharing files use the same software and version. Since Abode is the industry standard, a CorelDRAW user will be the odd man out, even though his software is not inferior.<br /><br />So if you want the most capable software, but don't want invest a year of car payments on a computer program, then CorelDRAW is the way to go.",3/17/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suddenly my firewall and anti virus stopped working. I contacted them and was told I had the old version (amazing as I'd only renewed my subscription a few months before). They asked me to delete the old version (just like previous years) and download the upgrade. A list of complicated instructions followed. I was annoyed but agreed. The only thing was the download didn't work. I tried 4 times. Frustrated and several blood pressure pills later I contacted their help people. I wanted a refund but they refused to give me one even though it was their error. I was outside the refund period they said. Their customer care is the worst I have encountered -ever.

Expression Studio 4 Web Professional Upgrade,Software,5,1,1,N,Y,A good product for webmasters,I made the jump from the original Expression Web software and was attracted by the ridiculously low price for this quality of a product upgrade. If you are a Front Page or earlier edition Expression Web user I think you'll be more than happy wih this choice. If you are new to web design software this is an excellent choice since expression web offers most features you'll find in any high quality comprehensive web design software with the addition of the Front Page extensions options which is a feature I really like as it makes building web pages and saving your work so quick and easy.,7/8/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are exciting games for me. I wanted something that I could play like when I was a kid. We didn't have TV or Computers, so we created our own excitement, with either cards or board games. You select your own profile, and select the players the players that you want to play with. These players are always making comments, and it makes the game more exciting. The games aren't dominated by the computer. Both you and the computer have a chance to win. You just have to use logic, like if you're playing a real game. It certainly has the ability to sharpen your mind, plus enables you to have playing opponents. The excitement is to be able to win some of the games. You don't want to be able to win them all. I rated these games at 5 stars. Everyone has their own opinion. I guess it's like everything else. No one is happy with everything, but these games are just what I wanted.",8/4/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Windows Vista Business FULL VERSION [DVD] [OLD VERSION],Software,4,2,6,N,N,A real review,"First off I want to respond to the previous users who have upgraded your pc's from Vista, obviously not a good idea whatsoever, you always want a clean copy of xp or system restore the laptop/desktop if you bought a name brand PC. People who are experiencing freezing, what are you guys talking about? There is obviously something wrong with your pc's. I have a Sony Vaio with 2GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo T5600 with Business on it, and the thing works very very well. Programs not working? Yea, only some of them if they require specific drivers that aren't developed for Vista. People saying Itunes, Firefox and other programs like that don't work, you've got to be extremely dumb not to realize that everything works perfectly. All the programs work listed above and even more now. Service Pack 1 will be released soon enough to fix any minor issues that haven't yet been fixed. If you don't know how to turn things off in the control panel, like UAC you probably should have someone do it for you. That is there for your protection. Windows Aero, can also be turned off if you don't like its little featuers like the popup windows and flipping. My Background: I have 6 computers running all versions from Home Premium to Ultimate of Vista and I have only had minor driver issues, with my sound card. THATS IT. Every company that I know of has perfectly stable drivers for most devices. People who say they can't find drivers for their printers and or other devices must be something that company doesn't support anymore and or they haven't looked in the correct places. Speed? I haven't noticed anything different, but I guess there obviously would be differences because Aero does take more memory to run the 3D interface. Epilisy? Uhh I suggest you go to a doctor, or stop using computers all together if you have this issue. And by the way its under mouse features.",3/18/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Windows 8 Pro - Upgrade [Old Version],Software,1,7,11,N,N,Now costs extra for media player,"About a year ago I cancelled my cable tv and bought a tuner that was designed to use with windows media center that came with the Windows 7 software on my computer. While I had a bit of trouble getting the digital over the air signal, a new outside antenna fixed that problem and between my Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus, I've been a very happy camper!<br /><br />The other day I bought a new laptop so that my mother in law could watch tv in her room and it came with Windows 8. I read up on this new program and NOWHERE did I see that they were doing away with Windows Media Player! So, I go to set it up and it's not there!<br /><br />I called Microsoft to see where it was and was informed that it would now cost me an extra $99.00 to upgrade so that I could have the media player. I griped and they then told me that I could upgrade to Windows 8 \\""Pro\\"" for $39,99. I didn't see where I should have to pay more for a lessor program, so I requested that they swap the windows 8 out for windows 7 and then we could call it a day.<br /><br />Nope, can't do that! They told me that I would have to contact Toshiba.<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong, but watching tv was the specific reason that we bought that computer and I don't see why I should have to \\""upgrade\\"" in order to get the same functionality that the older program had...aren't we supposed to be moving forward???<br /><br />I've now been waiting for a couple of hours for a supervisor from Microsoft to call me back and am two thirds towards running over to the Apple store and buying a Mac (which I've confirmed can be used to watch over the air tv with the purchase of a usb turner.)<br /><br />To say that I'm disappointed in Microsoft would be an understatement. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br /><br />Update...I still haven't heard back from the supervisor, so I called Microsoft's corporate number (425-882-8080) and asked to speak with the executive resolution group (or at least someone without a headset on) and was told that I would have to email them after giving them my personal information. I then asked if I could speak with the VP in charge of customer service and they refused to tell me who that was...so, I googled it and found an Blog post by a lady named Barbara Gordon where she slams google's customer service and compliments Microsoft's.<br /><br />I called the corporate office back and asked for Ms. Gordon's office and was told that I would have to initiate my correspondence via the US mail (really?? One of the world's largest technology companies and I have to send them a letter??? Seems like a stiff arm to me!",2/6/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This version, however, is an awful step backward. 1) Video produced by this program is only fair at best. 2) Video can be saved to hard drive in only one format (.mpg). 3) Disk burning is very slow (burning time for a 1.5 hour video was 2 hours).

This program, unlike [music website] which was a peer-to-peer music exchange, seeks out music titles that may be hiding on the Internet. WHile it lacks the convenience I enjoyed, it does a pretty good job of ferreting out files I'm seeking and also has some surprisingly nice features that aren't available from a search engine, such as:<BR>- ability to preview music before you download it<BR>- will not display deal links (search engines hold a lot of dead links in their cache, which you don't find out about until you try to download and get the dreaded File Not Found error)<BR>- maintains a list of sites where you previously found files<br />You can narrow your search to any of the following file types: Windows media, Real Audio Media, MPEG 2, MPEG 3, MP3, WAV or MIDI, or you can have the program search for any media type.

Microsoft Windows 7 Professional [Old Version],Software,5,7,11,N,N,Windows 7 is Windows Vista done right,"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista. Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista. But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new or improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:<br /><br />#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES<br />With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server. When coupled with Offline Files & Folders (a features that the non-Home editions of Windows offers since XP), you can easily take your server data with you, even when you're in a disconnected state. Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library. This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.<br /><br />#2 START SEARCH<br />The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, \\""change my display settings\\""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.<br /><br />#3 AERO SNAP<br />The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.<br /><br />#4 TASKBAR<br />Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.<br /><br />#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY (including XP Mode)<br />Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program. You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want. For truly stubborn XP programs, the Professional edition offers XP Mode -- a fully licensed, virtualized copy of Windows XP. Note that your hardware must support virtualization for this to work.<br /><br />#6 STICKY NOTES<br />Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!<br /><br />#7 JUMP LISTS<br />There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.<br /><br />#8 SAVED SEARCHES<br />In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).<br /><br />#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING<br />Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.<br /><br />#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL<br />Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.<br /><br />#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR<br />All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like \\""ribbon\\"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.<br /><br />#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING<br />This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and \\""access denied\\"" problems. While not appropriate for corporate use, this is great for the home. I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users. Note: all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.<br /><br />In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.e a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!<br /><br />#7 JUMP LISTS<br />There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.<br /><br />#8 SAVED SEARCHES<br />In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use.

Rosetta Stone V3: German Level 1-3 Set with Audio Companion [OLD VERSION],Software,1,3,5,N,N,Rosetta Stone is just a rip off,"I got the full course of Rosetta. It basically tries to teach you as you were a baby. There is nothing immersion about it. you have to guess what a picture is trying to say. Remember the old saying \\""A picture is worth a thousand words\\"". Basically what Rosetta Stone's pictures are. You cannot always guess what a word is by a picture. Sure the simple stuff. But nothing complex. German is a complex language. Has different case systems nominative, dative, genitive, accusative. There are different ways of expressing \\""the\\"" like das, die, der, des, dem. How are you suppose to know which one is which by looking at pictures and predefined combo boxes? Rosetta Stone just teaches you how to match pictures with words and simple fill in the space. It doesn't teach you grammar at all. Doesn't tell you how to write sentences and surely doesn't tell you how to express a feeling. It's an expensive flash card programme. You are better off learning from books than Rosetta Stone. It's just a media/promotion hype. You will never learn a language just from this program. I learned move from \\""Living Language Ultimate German Beginner Intermediate\\"" and Assimil German with Ease than I did from Rosetta in 2 months. I know more than 300 words and how to carry basic conversations. I wouldn't recommend this product to any one.",8/22/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secure IT File Compression and Encryption Software,Software,5,10,10,N,Y,Seems Great but . . .,"This program seems to work better than I expected. It is well-conceived and easy to use. One of the surprises was that it encrypts and stores files faster than just copying them to a backup. How? I don't know. Is it really military-grade and unbreakable for a 100,000 years? I'll take their word for it, but the whole idea of encryption has a weak link that everyone seems to ignore. The security of one's data is only as secure as one's password. Since my password is hardly military-grade secure, neither is the data I've encrypted. If someone really wants to attack my data, he would hardly try to break the encryption itself; instead, he'd break my password and decrypt the material without any effort whatever.<br />All that being said, I'm glad I bought the program and I kid myself that my backed-up data is safe when I take it mobile, despite understanding the weak link in the process. And,heck, it's so cheap, how can one complain? I'd buy it again.",6/16/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TurboTax Deluxe 2002,Software,1,18,20,N,N,Poor implementation of copy protection,"After using TurboTax for the past 6 years, I confidently installed it on my Windows 2000 machine, expecting the same comfortable interface I'd grown to, well, like. I was quite surprised when I received a popup stating that critical Windows 2000 files had been modified, and that I needed to restore them from my Win 2K installation disk! I dutifully did so, and then finished with the TurboTax installation.<br />I was disturbed to find 3 URL shortcut icons on my desktop, which I hadn't requested, each marketing some service that somebody thought I needed to know about. They were wrong and, in my estimation by so doing, arrogant, so I spent some time deleting them and their associated files and icons - a bad start, but just a taste of what was to come.<br />I then attempted the magic of the \\""One Step Update\\"", which (you'll see) wasn't and which didn't. So, I traveled to their website for the manual download. I then attempted to follow the update instructions which, like the initial instructions for Windows 2000, could not be followed as written. I tried anyway, and upon launching TurboTax, was pleased to discover that it had detected the existence of the update file and politely asked if I'd like to apply it. I answered a polite \\""Yes\\"", and watched as it failed in its task, giving a cryptic message which prompted another trip to the web site.<br />I discovered that the web site's translation of the cryptic error message was of no value in resolving the problem, so I launched the \\""Live Chat\\"" option. I'd have preferred the \\""Live Tech Rep\\"" option, but that privilege is reserved for those with ...[money] to spare for each call; not wanting to throw good money after bad, I connected with \\""E\\"", the Live Chat entity. I described my travails to \\""E\\"", who disappeared (dis-something, anyway - never really saw anything of him but characters). After a brief (actually the briefest of) conversations in which I think I failed to adequately convey my plight, he recommended the industry-standard \\""uninstall and reinstall\\"", the first tactic taught in Tech Support 101 and one which automatically presumes all customers are novices and haven't a clue.<br />In the process of following those \\""instructions\\"" to effectively disprove its validity, I discovered the heretofore unknown background C-Dilla installation, which took another half hour of research and downloading and run time to get rid of. By this time, I'd had enough...<br />The end result? I'm switching to TaxCut. This is certainly not what I've come to expect from Intuit, and I'd heartily recommend that you avoid this product like the West Nile virus.",1/29/2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linux Mandrake 7.1 Complete,Software,4,2,2,N,N,An excellent distribution for the the new user,"After having tested the Red Hat, Caldera, and SuSE versions of Linux, I settled on Mandrake 7.1 and have been using it for several months. The other distros are good in their own ways, but I highly recommend Mandrake for newbies. It has an extremely useful configuration tool, it supports much of the available hardware, and it offers a stable, Pentium-optimized kernel. The last poster seemed very frustrated, which is the reaction of some people who come to Linux for the first time. I'd like to offer some helpful pointers so people will try this OS and not get discouraged: 1. Most distros now have intuitive and very simple installation programs now. 2. The complaint that many internal modems won't work with Linux needs to be clarified-- software-enabled modems, Winmodems, are the standard today because they are cheap to produce. Yet they are truly not modems, because they have no on-board processor and instead use the main CPU. If you plan on using Linux with a modem, and you have no modem or you have a Winmodem, you need to purchase a real modem. These will generally be more expensive ($60-$80) but they are worth it because they don't slow your CPU down and you migrate to other operating systems without worrying about compatibility. 3. Any time you plan on using new software, you should read an instruction manual. This includes operating systems, and there are many books on Linux. 4. Supporting Linux, despite initial frustrations, will foster the already sizable Linux community and result in easier and more compatible versions, as well as showing your support for free software. 5. Use the Linux support community, which you link to from any of the distros' websites. Any possible difficulties you might encounter have been seen before, and the answers are everywhere.

TaxCut Platinum 2002,Software,1,2,2,N,N,What a nightmare!,"I had been a user of TurboTax for several years and was very satisfied with the results and ease of use. I had logged on one day to pick up a copy of Turbotax but based upon some of the reviews here I decided to get Taxcut. Big mistake. Taxcut is very buggy and it even locked up when I was first trying to register it online.<br />I had already calculated my taxes based using my tax info from 2002 and Turbotax deluxe 2001. I figured it should give me a ball park figure since tax laws can't change that much in one year. <br />At any rate TT estimated I should pay in a small amount. When I entered all the numbers in with Taxcut platinum it showed me as having in pay in almost tens times as much. I re-entered the data several times and it would give me different results but always on the high side. I even completed a brand new form and made sure I had the latest sotware update. It said I had the latest update but still yielded very high info on taxes and it wasn't a consistant number even though my tax info was constant.<br />Finally after messing around with this for about ten hours I decided I would just uninstall everything and throw the software disk and everything associated with Taxcut in the trash. Hopefully I can wipe this nightmare completely from my memory.<br />I ordered Turbotax today and I will used that program this year.<br />Taxcut is not a very user friendly program and in some of the interview questions it was mising a specific line number to get info from. Also, the look and feel of this program is a bit on the edge of being amateur/professional. Very similar to some of the shareware programs you can find where somebody wrote the program from their basement. It may be just a cut above that.<br />Looking back on some of the reviews of TT the negative on the product had more to do with the activation process rather than how the program performed. <br />If Taxcut has worked fine for you for years than stick with it but I am never going totouch this program again. I should have know better than to change something that was working fine for me.",2/6/2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9 [OLD VERSION],Software,4,5,6,N,N,Problem Solver,"I was having so many problems playing media, finding the right codecs for devices, and burning certain dvd formats. Roxio Easy Media has the solutions and they are all in one place. Perhaps my old disc player program didn't have certain formats, I'm not sure but some rental dvds didn't play. The rental store tested the disks and found they played on a regular dvd player but not a pc dvd. CinePlayer shows everything so far. I have a PSP and I could only find Sony's software which was expensive for dealing with only one format. I decided to try the Roxio suite since you get many more programs than just the PSP one. Now when I attach the PSP to my PC the program identifies the PSP and will choose the right codecs. I hear Sony willl have direct downloading to the PSP, but until then I can take the video and music from my pc and do a simple transfer. Before when I burned dvds they wouldn't play on my dvd player. It turns out that there is a separate format and the roxio program has that choice. I can make menus too that will work with my dvd player remote control. I can't say the program is perfect since it did have some types of warning popups. The programs still works but I have to click on the popups and they come more frequently they I would like.

Movie Studio Platinum Suite,Software,1,7,9,N,Y,Zero stars for a reason... it wouldn't install,"Movie Studio 10, great. Movie Studio 12, so far almost ZERO. After a couple of years of using Vegas Movie Studio Suite 10, I decided to buy Version 12, primarily for the faster processing with the video card in my $2000 Toshiba Qosmio X500 notebook, running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. Since buying Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 from Amazon in late Dec 12, I've asked two questions of Sony Vegas tech support online, and returned one box to Amazon for replacement. Sony has taken almost two weeks each to respond to my two questions, and I had to goose them twice with updates to the questions before I got a reply. The product as sold would not install on my computer, nor would large downloaded files for the three major parts [Movie Studio, Sonic Forge, DVD Architect]. I could READ and copy the installation DVD to hard disk, but I couldn't INSTALL any of the three parts from the DVD nor hard disk nor from downloaded files. As an aside, many other programs installed with ease during January, either from internal/external optical drives, or from hard drives or USB. Finally on 30 Jan 2013, Sony tech support sent a solution that partially worked. Between the *****s below. They sent: An update for Movie Studio Platinum 12 was released today which resolves some issues related to this incident. You may download the new update here. [...] My same-day reply to tech support, and you shouldn't settle for less: ***** \\""V 12.0.756 downloaded and it installed. However, I still can't install newer versions of Sound Forge or DVD Architect later than the ones that came with Version 10, either from the Sony-supplied disk or from recent downloads, [nor all the rest of the DVD that should automatically be on my hard drive]. If you notify me when you have such updates for those two programs, I will download and try to install them, and let you know whether they work. However, when I bought the product over a month ago, I did not agree to be an unpaidBeta-tester for Sony. After I have done your work for you, I expect you to supply me with a factory printed disk that will reinstall in the future with all three programs and supporting features. I intend to post a negative review on Amazon with the problems I've had and will recommend that no one buy the product until my problems are fixed. I will revise it once I am satisfied, with a caveat about buying only the latest production date software. Keep this incident open until you have supplied me with the product I paid for. ***** So my recommendation is to wait to buy this product until Sony fixes it unless you too want to have endless frustration and get a product that wasn't properly tested before release. Keep watching this space. Sure, lots of buyers will have no problems with the original version, but do you also want to take the chance on becoming an unpaid Beta-tester with all the hassles that entails, or do you just want to edit video? Sony Vegas 10 great, but no support any more. Sony Vegas 12, support can take weeks for a reply; not ready for prime-time. And that's before I've had a chance to try the new version which I should have been using a month ago.",1/31/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate UPGRADE DVD (OLD VERSION),Software,1,35,64,N,N,"So old, so wrong, so copied, so sad, so over.","Is it just me or was the curtain not pulled back years ago? Anyone tinkered with Office 2007 lately? Anytime you want to enable a new feature you HAVE to validate via WGA; surely no one is foolish enough to wonder why. Combine that with the atrocious DRM configurations and the constantly nagging UAC (not to be confused with the more powerful and elegantly implemented password/permissions implementation found on unix systems) which continuously displays decision making criteria that most people's mom's will never understand, and it's plain to see Vista is as transparent an OS experience as igneous rock.Many users continue comparing Vista to OS X, Ubuntu and other alternatives to what avail I have no idea. It must have something to do with the minds tendency towards dichotomies. There's a lot to be said for something that can stand firm on it's own, without the need for comparison. Vista can't. Microsoft's ability to disguise their cash crop as something other than just that becomes more obvious with each release. It's unfortunate for those that still can't see it, but time is on their side. Just as it's taken time for Microsoft to drill the idea home that Windows is the only OS available for anyone that wants to participate in the modern age, so to will it take time to pull people's attention far enough back from the shimmering illusion long enough to see outside the matrix. <br /> <br />My hope is that more and more people will eventually decide to unplug from the matrix in order to discover more elegant alternatives that are truly there to elevate experience and productivity instead of only sell, sell, sell. I have no vested interest in such an outcome hence ultimately the shape of things is of little consequence to me and others who have seen the light. I don't hate Microsoft, in fact I could care less. If anything I often feel overly embarrassed in regards to their products and tactics. Anyone who has ever cringed while watching Mikey's phone call to the answering machine in the film Swingers will know the feeling I speak of. Let's face it, \\""the WOW starts now!\\"" more or less sums up the caliber of the company and products at large. How else can Microsoft's decade-late arrival to the power of the Internet be explained? 2007 marks the year the concept of \\""Windows Live\\"" comes to be!? Are you kidding me!? Not to mention the immensity of the innovations behind the initiative: Windows Live Maps, Books, Ads, Spaces, Search, etc. Gee, those sound vaguely familiar. And then there's Zune; \\""Welcome to the Social.\\"" It's all so pathetically embarrassing I can't go on. I almost pity the fools. <br /> <br />Simply put, I know how empowering it was the first time I was introduced to Windows alternatives. A binary breath of incredibly fresh air sums up the experience; something I'll never forget, and certainly wish for others. <br /> <br />Vista, Office, and the overall Microsoft experience is none other than one big \\""Ultra\\"" pop-up.",2/7/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, if I desire to, I am happy to waste my time playing this game. It is fun and the modern update will probably make the younger generation feel more engaged with properties they grew up with.

This was never an issue in CS2, CS3, or CS4. Check the online forums - I'm not the only one with this difficulty. I have to open images in CS4 now to make a print.

Human Japanese,Software,5,165,172,N,N,Revolutionary,"About me: a freshman in college, took three years of Japanese in high school and now am taking it at my university. If you're just getting into Japanese, this is the best $24.95 you'll ever spend in your learning endeavors. It's essentially a sensei-in-a-box. The format is like how I was taught--you learn the writing while learning grammar while learning culture, but in a fluid, logical way. Short of taking a class or getting a tutor, this is the best way to learn Japanese. I even suggest it to those in beginning Japanese classes. It is an excellent supplement. The writing style is genuine and interesting, and it almost feels like the conversation of a close friend. It compels one to read further and takes away any sense of learning as a chore. Rosetta Stone is a poor excuse for a language-learning program. It's essentially a vocabulary building program with no actual thought to teaching the workings of a language. Not to mention that the aesthetics of this program are FAR superior than Rosetta, despite Rosetta's hefty price tag. Continually amazes me.

MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2013 Plus,Software,3,20,20,N,N,"Previous version (v18 ""MX"") is fine. This one still in beta!","[[VIDEOID:mo1HU93KQOSS4EH]]I'm writing this review from the perspective of an upgrade. For fuller reviews of MEP, see my 4 star review of MEP v17 and my 5 star review of [[ASIN:B005EJ2O9W Movie Edit Pro 18 MX Plus]]. (Always buy the \\""Plus\\"" version of MEP. Encoders are free, you get a dedicated music and photo editor, plus some other important enhancements.)<br /><br />Bottom line: MEP 2013 (a.k.a v19) is really a \\""point\\"" or incremental upgrade rather than a new version. There's no compelling reason to buy this \\""version.\\"" (I guess, like cars, they have to introduce a new model every year, whether needed or not.)<br /><br />In fact, in my tests, when it comes to encoding YouTube video (MP4) it's worse that the previous version. (See my accompanying video, where I recorded VLC player video of the same MP4 project encoded by MX vs 2013.) In fact, per the update below, the third party MP4 encoder that ships with Magix 2013 is still \\""beta!\\"" So the previous version 18 (a.k.a. [[ASIN:B005EJ2O9W Movie Edit Pro 18 MX Plus]]) is what you should buy.<br />====<br />UPDATE November 24, 2012: First, Magix just issued its second patch for v2013. Current version is now 12.0.2.2. They say they fixed a few things and I'll take their word for it. (Update December 6, 2012: After the patch, or after upgrading to a new (better) video card, I cannot play the Magix Demo anymore without the program hanging. Whereas I can play the Demo just fine on old v18 MX.)<br /><br />Second, they updated the third party Main Concept MP4 encoder! But it's still not right.<br /><br />Well at least Main Concept is updating their encoder. So there's hope. It's still not ready for prime time and I still have to use Magix MX (v18) to encode MP4 to get the results I want.<br /><br />Update November 2012: On an aside, Fry's Electronics had an Nvidia GT610 2GB video card on sale for $15 after rebate today. (CUDA 2.1) I installed and tried it this evening (pre-patch) with v2013. The new card works better with v2013 than my old card, an Nvidia GeForce 210. (CUDA 1.2) But even with a CUDA 2.1 engine, MP4 encodes in v2013 are still problematic.<br /><br />So I still say MX (v18) is the version to buy. Even though MX doesn't recognize my new GT610 video card for Hardware encoding ( I even uninstalled and reinstalled MX after I had installed the new video card. Perhaps the card is too new?), I get the best results encoding in software anyway. Faster than using the GPU too. (4 core AMD Phenom, 3.4GHz.)<br />=====<br />Review: I've been a happy MEP user from v12 to v15, then v17, v18 (a.k.a. \\""MX\\"") and today, this, v19 (a.k.a. \\""2013\\""). It just came out. Fry's sold it for $25. While I don't mind having spent only $25, it was a waste of money and it's not worth upgrading. In fact, it's arguably worse! Stay, or buy, Movie Edit Pro 18 MX Plus and you've gotten the biggest bang for your buck. (See my 5 star review there.) For example, v18 came with a nice, thick, printed user's guide. v2013 does not. (Instead the PDF on the DVD.) As it turns out, there's a reason for not supplying a printed version this time. The product was released before even the PDF caught up!<br /><br />I use MEP to make YouTube videos. Probably overkill, since MEP is a professional package, a consumer version of Magix's Video Pro X series. But I have availed myself of some fancy features in my YouTube videos using the Multi-cam feature and Picture in Picture. (If you can imagine it, you can probably do it in Magix.)<br /><br />So my focus is on basic time line editing stuff. I don't burn DVD's with fancy chapters or menus. I don't do 3D. (A dying fad.) I don't have a fancy AVCHD camera either. I just import MPEG-2's or MOV's or AVI's, which goes fast enough in v18. (I suspect, in this day and age of cell phone cameras and pad cameras, not many people are doing AVCHD and/or 3D either.) MP4 performance for YT uploads is what's important to me.<br /><br />Here's the biggest difference I can tell with this new version: The third party Main Concept H.264 MP4 encoder has been updated in v2013.<br /><br />So first off, I couldn't import my old export presets (.PRU files) to the new version. Well, I could. But I don't think everything transferred the same. Or maybe the new encoder is a bit buggy and switches aren't getting set properly. For I took old v18 projects, opened them in v2013, and encoded to MP4 as before. While the time to encode was about the same or perhaps slightly faster (when I used my CPU, as opposed to my GPU), the file sizes were larger and, at first, the videos wouldn't play completely through! And when they would (after some tweaking of complicated MP4 encoder parameters) they were badly pixelated on zooms. (See my video review here.)<br /><br />I tweaked the \\""academic settings\\"" in the advanced options of the MP4 encoder for hours in MEP 2013 to match the parameters in v18, but even then I could not achieve the same excellent results as I had gotten in v18. (Defined as good quality video and low file size.) So maybe I'll edit in v2013, and encode my projects in v18. (I presume project files are backward compatible, but that wasn't true from v15 to 12. Update: I have made a few projects now in v19 and opened them in v18 without any problems.) Or maybe not. There's no real difference in the interface that I can tell either.<br />====<br />UPDATE: I was finally able to get v2013 to make good MP4, but at twice the file size of MX! I wonder if this isn't a purposeful decision to win speed contests (at the expense of file size) to win PC Magazine reviews as the \\""fastest.\\"" But I'd rather take an extra minute encoding to a smaller file size now to save 10 minutes uploading later.<br />====<br />To give some history, Magix made its biggest speed and interface improvements in v18 (\\""MX\\"") which took advantage of your graphic card's GPU. That made it so encoding went faster but used your CPU less! Amazing. It's obvious Magix has written even more code to use your GPU in v 2013. But I only have a low end Nvida card, with limited CUDA support (albeit DirectX 11). As such, when I tell the program to use my GPU to encode an MP4, it takes four times longer to encode as compared to letting my CPU do it! (Although my CPU is only at 20% when using the GPU vs. 75% w/o.) But when I let the GPU do it in v2013, I lose some MP4 encoder functionality. Fortunately, using the GPU is user selectable. YMMV, depending on the graphic card you have. But I suspect we're already on the diminishing returns part of this curve. I mean, it takes only a few minutes to encode a five minute YouTube video with v18. Would it really matter to me if it did it in a minute? (I guess if you're making family videos that fill entire DVD's, speed becomes important. But in this day and age of Twitter and 140 character messages, does anyone sit down that long to watch long videos anymore?)<br /><br />As far as interface improvements on v18, Magix is moving toward more use of the preview monitor for some editing tasks. So now you can open a video in the preview monitor and do your in and out trims intuitively before placing them in the movie. (No multi-trim, per se, but you could trim here, drag and drop, and then repeat to get the same result as multi-trim.)<br /><br />Magix claims some \\""improvements\\"" from v18, but nothing I thought was lacking in v18. For example, Magic says the Title Editor is improved. But I'm hard pressed to notice any real difference. (I think they undid some of the \\""improvements\\"" in Patch 2.)<br /><br />The only really new thing Magix hypes is speed improvements for high end AVCHD importing on high end systems. \\""The AVCHD file import feature has been improved and is now more than 40% faster*. Rendering test projects (AVCHD Full HD) with IntelÂ® Quick Sync Video, AMDÂ®/OpenCL(tm) or NVIDIAÂ® CUDA(tm) for the Apple iPad is now up to twice as fast in Movie Edit Pro 2013 Plus*.\\"" But that's for the iPad. Frankly, I bet most people download stuff into their iPad off the net instead of making their own videos for them. Again, I make videos for YT. So, not to take anything away from the Magix software engineers, none of these speed improvements matters to me.<br /><br />\\""Calculating effects directly on the graphic card's GPU is now over 90%* faster, the biggest speed boost out of all the improvements.\\"" Maybe so. But I must not have any bizarre effects that slow things down because I've never noticed a problem with previews. Version 18 came with preview rendering, where you could pre-calculate difficult transitions. But I never needed to use it. I don't make eye candy transitions and effects. (Content is what matters.) Update: For grins, I tried a fancy 3D transition. Okay, on my overclocked 4 core AMD (3.4GHz), the playback is jerky if you don't pre-calculate. I suppose if I had a high end GPU graphics card, it would play smoother on preview. But I don't ever expect to use this transition. Update December 2012: With my newer video card, the transitions do render better in preview.<br /><br />So, if you want to update MEP from an earlier version, update to v18. If you own MEP v18, stay there. If you're looking to buy MEP, buy v18. It's cheaper and makes better MP4's than this newer version. At least at this point in time. If they ever fix the Main Concept MP4 encoder, then this version would be acceptable.<br /><br />I usually only update to every other version and I would have been wise to wait for a v20 before spending any money. Although, at this point in the life of MEP, I don't know what else they could add. (It would be nice if the program could read my mind so I didn't have to change between ripple modes.) As it is now, v18 does most everything I want and it does it well. (Even if I had the full blown Video Pro X, what difference would it make? I don't even know what \\""3-way color correction\\"" is. Update: I watched their tutorial on this on YT. Okay, even now that I know what 3-way color correction is, I don't see any need for it.)<br /><br />Truly, I don't know what more one could want in a video editor. (Some professional reviewers want \\""multi-trim.\\"") But Magix, if you're reading this, I'd like an in sutu bitmap editor, where I could draw a mask (square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, with or without feathering) in the video monitor and use that as a selection to pixelate parts of images, etc. (To be fair, in v19 (2013), Magix did make it so you could open their bitmap editor from MEP, make a mask, and kinda sorta resave that new image for use in MEP. So they're getting there. It's a bunch of steps now, which I expect will be streamlined into the Preview editor in a future version someday.",10/13/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Norton SystemWorks 2008 Standard Edition 11.0,Software,1,2,2,N,N,Symantec a loser in my book,"For anyone considering buying the Symantec Norton SystemWorks product, I would advise them to consider these failures of the product and support. In Feb. 2008, I contacted Symantec by chat because my Norton SystemWorks subscription had expired and a \\""subscription expired\\"" alert was displaying every 30 seconds. When I chose Renew inside the product, as documented, the Live Update dialog was displayed instead of the Renewal Center panel. I waited for the chat through the 67 customers who were ahead of me. In the chat session, the technician could not make renewal work inside the product and eventually sent me a link to the Symantec site to renew, which I did. The product continued to display the subscription expired alert. The technician suggested a couple of options to stop the alert, which did not work. One of the options would have terminated the chat, which I told him when a message was displayed that indicated this. The technician was still in the process of trying to stop the alert messages when the chat connection was lost and the chat terminated. I was left with subscription alerts popping up every 30 seconds after I had resubscribed, and after rebooting. When I resubscribed, I noticed that the \\""Subscription Service\\"" date inside the product on the antivirus status screen was 5/9/2008 instead of one year later, 2/13/2009. From reading tech tips on the site, I determined that when I renewed, the system date was 5/9/2008. I corrected the system date, and the alert messages stopped. But I still had this problem: How do I reset the Subscription Service date inside SystemWorks to the correct date (2/13/2009) so that it does not expire in May and I have to try to contact tech support again? After the chat which was disconnected, I submitted the question to tech support by e-mail. After several days had passed with no response, I confirmed that no Symantec mail had been blocked as spam, then resubmitted the question twice. Although e-mail response is committed to 96 hours, I have received no response 36 days after the original incident date. I feel that this combination of failures of product, technical support by chat, and technical support by e-mail is noteworthy, even today when technical support routinely ranges from poor to abusive.",3/19/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quicken Essentials for Mac,Software,5,2,2,N,N,amazingly great!,"I was so hesitant to purchase Quicken due to its overwhelmingly negative reviews on Amazon.

I can easily categorize individual transactions, which are automatically imported for me from my various bank accounts and credit cards.

Microsoft Office Standard 2007 UPGRADE [Old Version],Software,2,159,171,N,N,Before You Upgrade -- Things You Need to Know,"Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong. <br /> <br />You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed. <br /> <br />I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. <br /> <br />So what are my issues? The list is long: <br /> <br />-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity. <br /> <br />-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer. <br /> <br />-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again. <br /> <br />-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it. <br /> <br />-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it canoften be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one? <br /> <br />-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break. <br /> <br />-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug. <br /> <br />-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility. <br /> <br />There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar. <br /> <br />But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better! <br />",3/28/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Norton Internet Security 2009 [OLD VERSION],Software,5,7,7,N,N,"Small footprint, minimal distractions.","I'd heard Norton 2009 was a dramatic improvement over previous editions and, since Zone Alarm still won't work with my 64-bit Vista, I canceled my Zone Alarm purchase and got Norton Internet Security for the three computers in my house. Just out of curiosity I find myself checking it from time to time just to be sure it's working. It is, of course. It's just much more unobtrusive than any security suite I've ever used before. So far I'm very enthusiastic. And since I've also heard the telephone help has been improved, it feels like I'm going to get very comfortable using Norton exclusively for all my computers.",10/24/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QuickBooks Pro 2013,Software,2,0,0,N,Y,The product is inconvenient to use,"My accountant requested I upgrade from Quicken to QuickBooks Pro. The interface is not nearly as intuitive as it could be. For example, it is not possible to make deposits using the &#34;check book register.&#34; Entering other data at times causes convoluted glitches to occur. The required registration had glitches too. Although I followed the (for once intuitive) procedure to completion, the program said I had not yet registered, and had but a few, decreasing number of days to do so. But, it would not let me either begin again or &#34;complete&#34; the registration. This required a call to Intuit, whose telephone number is not on the box, and is not immediately accessible on their website (for example, there is no &#34;contact us&#34; on the home page). That required a half hour on the phone waiting for a 30 second fix--apparently this happens all the time; the phone rep knew what had to be done. Finally, I had all my data entered and was ready to meet my accountant with plenty of time to prepare the taxes. My accountant's 2012 QuickBooks Pro could not read the data from my 2013 QuickBooks Pro. Come on, Intuit. That's just rude.",4/18/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mac OS X version 10.6.3 Snow Leopard (Mac computer with an Intel processor required),Software,1,2,6,N,N,Snow Leopard - DO NOT INSTALL!,"I purchased OSX 10.6 \\""Snow Leopard\\"" about a month ago and can only say: WARNING - DO NOT install on your Mac! I have a new 2009 8-core MacPro with 6Gb of RAM. After installing Snow Leopard: 1- Most of my software seemed a lot more crash-prone, one program in particular that I use fairly often crashed on average after 5-7 minutes of use, every time. 2- Another program would not start at all, Images from my digital camera could not be transferred because of this. 3- I noticed immediately that my computer was a little slower after the upgrade, but after updating to the latest patch (10.6.2) it got unbearably slow. The little spinning rainbow would appear all the time and software would freeze for seconds at the time. After rolling back and re-installing Leopard from the discs that came with my machine I noticed a significant overall speed increase, but I also had to reinstall several programs, updates and transfer all my files. A major hassle that has taken me several hours and been complicated. Conclusion: DO NOT CONSIDER INSTALLING SNOW LEOPARD! PS! If you want to reinstall a previous OS, make sure you select the option to save the current OS (Snow Leopard) system files and other user files (your files) to a separate folder. Unless you do this the install will delete all your files..",11/11/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eMedia Interactive Rock Guitar,Software,5,12,13,N,Y,Took a bit to get started...,"I had a bit of a delay in getting the software started, the support hours are fairly limited, but once I got the help I needed, everything has gone swimmingly. I'm editing my previous review to reflect that.<br /><br />Once running, the software is extremely easy to use and follow and although a bit simplistic at first, there is a definite progression into more difficult techniques.<br /><br />I think this is a near perfect transition for a player who knows the notes on the strings and wants to learn rock power chords and move from playing note by note into chords. For those players who can read tabs, but might not know the actual notes on the string the software offers a great transition from counting frets to thinking about the notes you are playing in terms of chords. A great asset when trying to play unfamiliar music without tablature.<br /><br />The software is a great addition to the arsenal, and offers an amazing transition into chords if you are not used to playing them. It offers all this with a rock background, keeping the practice from becoming too repetitive or boring and allowing you to practice music that sounds like a real song.",6/2/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a client that needed this product(I own it and recommended it to him), so I ordered it, trying to save him a few bucks. End result - I never got the product, never got an explanation nor an apology and nothing from Amazon either. I just got a credit on my credit card, so no, it didn't cost me anything except that to meet my obligations, I had to run to the retail store and purchase this. Instead of saving my client a couple of bucks, it cost him extra (and it cost me some credibility). I would have eaten the $50 extra, but my client would have none of that.

H&R Block At Home 2010 Premium Federal + State + eFile,Software,1,1,1,N,N,"Usually pleased, but there's a problem!","If you're reading this because you googled \\""string id insertion failed\\"", \\""65536 already used as a key\\"", or \\""the tax return you selected cannot be loaded\\"", then welcome to the club. The bad news (it's short) is that your data file is toast and you'll have to restart... I've used H&R Block software (used to be TaxCut) for around ten years now. Been pleased all that time. 2010 was a complicated tax year for me, and man, was I glad to be able to use software to get it done. LOTS of forms, calculations, etc. (three \\""businesses\\"", a home sale/repurchase, and some unusual stock profits), but after a couple dozen hours I had it all entered and then used the e-file option for both state and federal. Submitted both and the program was happy. It even allowed me to \\""check the status\\"" even though I had just a few minutes before done the e-file. Everything worked. Easy-peasy. Then I closed the program. Sigh. That's when my trouble began. About a half-hour later, thought I'd reopen the file to check something. Program came up, file listing on the opening screen came up. But when I clicked on the file to open it I received a dialog box with the dreaded message reiterated in the first paragraph of this review. Slight feeling of panic welled up. Tried again. Same message. Closed program and reopened. Tried to open the program. Same message. Rebooted computer, opened program, same message. Sigh. Called customer support. Pleasant but ignorant CSR tried to find solution using her computer. Slowly asked me to repeat error message. I guess she was googling it using HRB's database. Hey, I can do that, what do I need her for? Came up with zip. Asked to put me on hold so she could talk to someone more knowledgable. Came back and gave me the \\""file is toast\\"" message. Fume mode on. Didn't rip her up (wasn't her fault), but told her how unsatisfactory the situation was. Spewed for a bit, thanked her, then hung up. Lucky me. I ran a back up the night before and had essentially the samefile saved which was uncorrupted. Copied it over and modified the name to distinguish it from the original and it opened just fine. Unfortunately, it wasn't the file that had the e-file information in it, so I can no longer use the program to check for e-file status (that ability was lost with the integrity of the original file), but can use the HRB web site to check e-file status. Thank God I had a backup. But I'll seriously consider going over to TurboTax next year. I quit TT ten years ago when they surreptitiously installed some anti-piracy garbage along with their program (by default - no choice on the user's part) and it played havoc with my system. Took me a dozen hours to fix things, and they later came out and publicly admitted this approach was a mistake. But I had resolved to go to a competitor (TaxCut) next time around. Now that ten years have passed and H&R Block @ Home (nee TaxCut) has screwed this file integrity thing up I'll reconsider TurboTax next year. Considering the investment in time to enter the information, and the criticality of financial records in general, why didn't HRB simply have an automagic backup routine built into the program?",4/16/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KASPERSKY INTERNET SECURITY 2012 3U (WIN XPVISTAWIN 7),Software,5,2,3,Y,N,We believe Kaspersky is the best; entering our second year of using the product,"My family used Kaspersky in 2011; we were impressed with the protection it provided and didn't hesitate with our decision to use Kaspersky in 2012. The installation of Kaspersky 2012 was quick and easy; it took about ten minutes. Kaspersky 2012 erased the 2011 version without issue. It was a seamless installation process.<br /><br />One of the nice things that we found about Kaspersky is that remaining days left on your old license count toward the new version. We still had 30 days left on our 2011 program and the 30 days will be added on to the year that we receive with the 2012 version. Essentially, the user is not \\""jipped\\"" - you get all the days that you paid for even though you are installing new software.<br /><br />There are far too many features in the program to rehash here, but it's safe to say that Kaspersky has every tool you would ever need to lock down a Windows 7 PC and many you will never even use. What makes Kaspersky really stand above its peers are the following three points:<br /><br />1) Detection ability -- Kaspersky is always at the top of independent lab reviews for scanning ability.<br /><br />2) System usage -- Kaspersky has a very small memory footprint and CPU demands. It's almost unnoticeable even when running multiple programs in multiple windows.<br /><br />3) Easy to use interface -- I liked the 2011 interface more than the 2012, but it's still very intuitive and user friendly. The automatic defaults mean that 95% of people will never have to touch a setting.<br /><br />Overall, Kaspersky is the leader among security software and anyone thinking of Kaspersky should start with the Internet Security package. It combines every feature you need with top performing detection ability and minimal resource usage. This product is highly recommended.",12/5/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite - 3 Users [Old Version],Software,4,4,4,N,N,Peace of Mind is Mine!,"I purchased the newest version of Zonealarm Internet Security Suite (2007)after I learned that my computer had 1000's of spyware on it despite my using free spyware, antivirus, and firewall programs. I bought this program as well as Spysweeper's antispam software (2007) and needless to say my computer is free of anything that can cause my computer to slow down to a non functional crawl, freeze up, or be invaded by unwanted hackers' innovation. No more shall I use the free 'helps' available despite their claims for success. I'd gladly pay (now) the annual licenses for Zonealarm to keep my computer healthy. I had read all of the critics (both positive and negative) about this product and other similar manufacturers products, and I concluded that there is not one single product that exists that pleases 100% of the people 100% of the time. So having used Zonealarm before in the past, considering its pros and cons with this software, being familiar with its format, and considering what my computing needs are, this is truly an excellent product as is the Spysweeper program. The only drawback, thus a 4 star rating, is that the installation was a bit of a hassle being installed onto Windows XP, until I learned from Microsoft's website how to get around the problem. The reason I purchased Spysweeper's anti-spyware software, is because it was recommended to me as the #1 means to combatting against spyware. So I have it, like an addendum to a book, to doubly keep certain my computer will always be clean from spyware. Since this was my primary problem, I most likely overreacted. I suspect Zonealarm Suite is good enough as it has all of the needed programs to protect my computer. For when I run the spysweeper program weekly, it tells me that my computer is 100% free of any spyware. Thus I can conclude that Zonealarm is doing what it was designed to do. As far as speed, my computer runs probably a little slower only because Zone alarm is constantly running 'behind thescenes' keeping my computer free of the [...] that is on the Internet. Since its installation, about 2 months now, it has blocked thousands of spyware, adware, and viral attempts. I am willing to have a bit of an operation slow down for that kind of peace of mind!",5/18/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade,Software,3,2,3,N,N,It's fine. But not worth it.,"I'm just an everyday user. I use my laptop to check email, surf the web, watch movies, nothing extraordinary. I'll be honest, I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate because my college offers it at a bargain price. I don't do very complicated things with my laptop, so all the little technicalities that are supposedly awful with Vista didn't affect me too much. There are quite a few things that are redeeming with this OS. My favorite feature is the snap function. I do a lot of multitasking and this feature is incredible. Saves time, works seamlessly. I like how the gadgets aren't limited to the sides of the desktop and can be moved around everywhere. The themes are fairly cool and you can also make your own desktop background slideshow. UAC is nowhere near as obnoxious. Overall, it does boot faster than Vista, so no complaints there. Mostly everything works. Wireless works. My printers and external hard drives work. The actual process of upgrading was easy. I popped the disc in and it did its thing. I'm lukewarm on the new taskbar format. I loved it at first, but it's annoying if you're working with multiple windows of the same program. You must hover over the button on the taskbar in order to show all the windows that are running in that one program. There is about a half-second lag between when you hover and when the little screens pop up. It saves space for those who work with many, many windows simultaneously as it combines all of the windows from one program into one button, essentially. However, there is a way to go back to the traditional taskbar, and I opted to do that. Additionally, you must download your run-of-the-mill basic software (photo gallery, Windows Mail) from Microsoft or other places because Windoes 7 got rid of them. That part wasn't a big deal. My biggest gripe with Windows 7 is HDMI. The audio does not transfer over to the television, ladies and gentlemen. You're stuck using your built-in PC speakers or plugging in a set of external speakersout of the headphone jack. The video appears just fine, but there is no sound!!! The worst part is, this functioned perfectly well in Vista. Apparently you need to upgrade your video/sound drivers according to Microsoft, but there is yet a solution for this problem. If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know. I've researched this topic endlessly. Type in \\""windows 7 hdmi no audio\\"" or something of the sort in google and you will see that I'm not the only one with this problem. Extremely frustrating! Also, some of my special function keys aren't working. I've spent countless hours downloading drivers and fiddling around trying to get this to work, but nada. I would honestly wait. It's slightly better than Vista, but not $200 better. And if you're a frequent user of HDMI, you might want to stick with XP or Vista until they figure this out. ---- EDIT ---- I bought a new hard drive and did a clean install of W7 Ultimate on it. Needless to say, my laptop is definitely running a lot more smoothly now. All of my laptop's special keys finally work. HDMI audio works now, but you have to enter the sound settings in the control panel and set the hdmi output as your default sound every single time you want to use it. Still irritating, but at least I don't have to rely on external speakers. I've discovered that you must do a clean install and then download the appropriate W7 drivers from your computer manufacturer's website. Simply doing an in-place install and then downloading the drivers will not do the trick, as I learned months ago. If you are considering W7 Ultimate, definitely format your hard drive, do a clean install, and then download drivers. It's a pain initially, but it's worth the effort. I'm keeping the rating to 3 stars, because the in-place install is worthless.",2/4/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been using it for several months now, and it is simply fantastic. It has improved my own budget skills, and I have been at this for more than a decade.",3/3/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2003 [OLD VERSION],Software,5,24,24,N,N,"Very good content, very good software, very good product.","I've bought both ENCARTA and BRITANNICA for years. This is my opinion:<BR>TEXT: The Britannica is a superb encyclopaedia in text since 1768. If only its electronic version were worthy of it! Text in the electronic version is different from Printed Encyclopaedia (large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more articles than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like \\""Spain\\"" are only one with a lot of subdivisions in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are considered articles, and you must \\""jump\\"" from one subdivision to other.<BR>In some areas Encarta is better than Britannica. For example consider &quot;controversial events in modern history&quot; such us \\""My Lai Massacre\\"": In Encarta one large article and a lot of mentions in others; Britannica does not even know the name.<BR>In theory, you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work. Encarta is updated free EVERY WEEK) with new articles and additions to the old ones. The new articles and additions are included in the next version of Encarta, but this is not true for Britannica. For instance: \\""Bilbao, Spain\\"": Britannica does not mention the Guggenheim Museum, which opened in 1997, and the population is !!estimated!! of 1982. The same article in Encarta: similar text, 3 photos, 1 map, related articles, sidebar, dynamic timelines and 4 internet pages, plus one specific article \\""Bilbao Guggenheim Museum\\"". I think Britannica updates its contents very slow, whereas Encarta is completely alive.<BR>MULTIMEDIA: They say that \\""serious\\"" or \\""adult\\"" readers do not care about \\""pictures\\""; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, \\""A picture is worth a thousand words\\"". Works of art, anatomy, maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, maps, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries (not very good though), atlas, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, timeline, games ... It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated. Britannica's Atlas is a joke and statistics do not exist or I have not found them. Encarta's has a great detail: 1 cm/ 4 km all over the world (though you find some mistakes) and hundreds of statistical maps.<BR>INTERFACE AND SOFTWARE: This is the worst side of Britannica. In Encarta you only have to type a phrase, a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it. If you have typed the name of a small village, you see it in the Atlas without clicking again. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you find what you were looking for. To go \\""jumping\\"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the \\""Related Articles\\"" section. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. If you don't understand a word, you can double-click it and the dictionary appears in a window.<BR>Navigating with Britannica is different. You get crazy. I will only give an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings. The dictionary does not permit double-clicking of words in the text of articles for their definitions. Once an article is displayed you cannot search for a word within the article. This is extremely annoying: you have to perform this task yourself. One \\""pro\\"" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh computers.<BR>This is my piece of advice: If you can afford it, buy both. If not... read again this review.",12/27/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is nice with this is that it is all in one place but you may find it takes a bit to get used to navigating through the menus. Having the Nolo books included is great as their publications are always high quality and contain good information. The dated look this program has when you pull it up made me knock off a few stars as it doesn't really give the appearance of being all that current and makes you wonder how current the material is, even though it says 2013. If you are looking for very basic forms and contracts and are somewhat unfamiliar with business forms such as these this would be a good resource, particularly for someone getting started with a small business for the first time.",2/20/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Movie Studio Platinum Suite,Software,5,5,16,N,Y,"I expect to like it! Then, and Now...","UPDATE:<br />Back when there was only 5 reviews of version 12, 2 reviewers gave this product 1 star, thus giving the impression of \\""Buyer Beware!\\""<br />This was quite puzzling after I had done research on this as a quality product.<br />Thus, I purchased the product, and wrote the following \\""review\\"", which I later updated, below the original.<br />If someone was researching what Amazon reviews said about the product, and thus read the negative reviews,<br />I wanted to reassure them I was ordering this without hesitation!<br />Also, there was a lot of strong evidence, it was a superior product, at a comparitively low price!<br />( No I don't work for Sony. see my other reviews.)<br />Thus my original review:<br /><br />OK, don't be put off by the low scores. Perhaps because, so far, there are few reviews?<br />I researched and have purchased this from Amazon. I think my decision is reasonable.<br />I have yet to receive it by mail. Am I taking a chance? Sure, but the evidence shines through to the positive.<br />Of course I will update my 4 star rating up or down, once I recieve it and use it a bit.<br />I rated 4 stars because, I didn't want to put more people off, from seriously considering this product.<br /><br />Here's the logic;<br />1.) This software is exactly the same as version 11, with the exception of being 64 bit and it can be adjusted to use popular brand GPUs.<br /> In other words, some one familiar with version 11 sees very little difference in the layout except some additional plugins.<br /> Version 11 has a nice user base, and a good rating from people who use it.<br /> Users of lower versions of this product, who have upgraded to this 64 bit version have reported a huge difference in speed. Look for yourself.<br /><br />2.) Version 12 \\""stand alone\\"", has a good rating right here on Amazon. This suite IS version 12 stand alone, with additional programs included!<br /> Judge the ratings by viewing Music Studio Platinum 12. But also check out version 11's reviews. Look elsewhere besides Amazon for more reviews.<br /><br />3.) Included with the \\""stand alone\\"" version of \\""Music Studio Platinum 12\\"", is \\""Sound Forge Audio 10\\"".<br /> This also is a stand-alone program that seemlessly melds into the video program.<br /> The 2 combined stand alone prices, are well above the Suite price. Check it out.<br /> I already own and use Sony's Acid Pro 7, and the layout of both Sony products in Movie Studio PL 12 have the same work flow.<br /><br />4.) I have asked questions about this product from a certain person who makes instuctional videos on how to use this and other \\""Sony Vegas\\"" incarnations.<br /> His videos are easily found on the internet.<br /> I asked him about the compatability between the suites 64 bit Movie Studio, and the 32 bit Sound forge.( I bet you never thought of that! )<br /> He explained, Both programs are working with manipulating files. And they work together very well.<br /> A 64 bit program or a 32 bit program, do not change an MP3 file into 32 bit or 64 bit! Video files are the same!<br /> He explained that it has to do with speed. Music files are small. So a 32 bits is fast for rendering music.<br /> Rendering even complex music files, is nothing compared to rendering video. Especially the video Movie Studio is capable of producing. Thus 64 bit is an upgrade!<br /><br /> Yes this is \\""Sony VEGAS Music Studio HD Platinum Production Suite 12\\"". Sony just decided to remove the words \\""Vegas\\"", \\""HD\\"", and \\""Production\\"".<br />I will update my opinion, as soon as I receive and use the product. I may have to eat Humble Pie, but I don't let that deter me from what I expect to be a good upgrade<br />after mastering Windows Movie Maker. LOL!<br />Let's Face it, most people examining this product are looking to upgrade from something simpler, but they're not looking for something as complex as \\""full on\\"" Premier or Vegas.<br /><br />Secondary review: I was not surprised when I recieved Sony Movie StudioPlatinum 12 Suite, that it was what I expected, and more.<br />The main disk includes 3 Sony stand alone programs, that can be purchased separately at a higher cost.<br />1.)

Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate UPGRADE DVD (OLD VERSION),Software,5,65,108,N,N,Smooth Upgrade Install--Excellent Performance,"Having bought and installed every version of Windows this installation and upgrade (from Windows Home XP) was the smoothest. Microsoft's Beta testing appears to have been very successful. By the way, I am just an average home computer user. <br /> <br />Vista first inventories the software and hardware and indexes whatever files are needed for the transfer. Then it installs, which took about an hour in my case on a Celeron D CPU at 2.13 Megahertz and a little over 1G of memory, with the standard Dell-Intel graphics chips (not exactly a high-end computer). <br /> <br />The look and feel and the interfaces and integration of Vista with other software is awesome. The software has killer diagnostic tools that are a cut above the usual third party software algorithms--for example, Vista remembers what has been tried and tells you so if you try to repeat a recommended \\""fix\\"". I liked, and installed two \\""gadgets\\"" in the left sidebar--a floating office--style clock and a calendar. <br /> <br />All the software on my machine functioned after the install and reboot, even software Vista identified as possibly not working--in my case, the Intellipoint mouse software. It did work just fine. <br /> <br />The install did kill my broadband internet connection for a brief time; and after going 'round and 'round with the idiots at Adelphia/Comcast customer service--who stated that company modems did not work with Vista, and that they are not ready to offer help for their customer running Vista (do not believe them)--I fixed the connection after discovering (through a Vista diagnostic tool) that competing firewalls from Windows Security Center and Windows Live One Care were blocking inbound streams. <br /> <br />In fact, Vista has a very nice feature in its Windows Security Center (that helped me fix my broadband connectivity) which tells you when you have competing security features enabled. In my case, it was two firewalls, one of which (Windows Live One Care), wasset to \\""restricted\\"". When I removed this firewall, and left the Security Center firewall enabled everything worked perfectly. <br /> <br />By the way, despite what I read elsewhere, my iTunes runs smoothly. I also have lots of third party software (defraggers, spy removal software, password software, etc.) on my computer, and all of it, except the well-known buggy and unstable System Mechanic 7, operates without problems, and did so without having to download \\""patches\\"". <br /> <br />I believe Microsoft did a great job on producing and testing Vista. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to move beyond XP. <br />",2/3/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the most part, TurboTax lived up to my expectations. However, as a first-time user, I made a few mistakes (didn't have all of my wife's documentation and I lost a charity receipt that I had recorded in my computer records) so I had to resubmit. I hoped that, since I found these errors just minutes after submitting my TurboTax for direct bank deposit, that I could start all over again without amending my taxes and having to print out the amendment and having to send it snail mail to the IRS and state. I was wrong. Once you submit your results, you have to amend any caught mistakes no matter how soon after, which can put a red flag on your finances and catch the attention of the IRS and state. I've never been audited and the very thought is troubling indeed.

QuickBooks Pro 2011 - [Old Version],Software,3,1,1,N,Y,DID I REALLY NEED IT?,"As with all of my Amazon purchases to date, overall service is 5 stars. I start the review with this, because I purchased the product as an unwilling participant. I've been a QB user for at least twelve years and have upgraded the product based on a willingness to upgrade and improve my accounting systems. This upgrade has me a little more than annoyed as it was an unwilling upgrade. As many have felt, the current economy has all businesses scrambling to save themselves financially. QB decided their current subscribers needed to upgrade their entire accounting system in order to cure a systems security issue with their online mail and credit card processing, in-lieu-of a security patch. The minimum cost to upgrade is appx. $230.00+++. While $230.00 may not seem like a lot of money when spread over the years, when times are tight $20.00 seems to have value again. Without the upgrade, my business would have come to a creep with the discontinued abilities to electronically bill or send e-mails. Since the QB system is all proprietary, a user cannot cut-n-paste an invoice to send over their own private e-mail systems with the older versions, it requires the use of QB to accomplish this through the QB servers. That's the bad side. The good side is, QB now allows the use of private e-mail v. going through the QB servers to e-mail invoices, with a small hitch, QB asks for the e-mail password every time an e-mail billing or statement is sent through private e-mail. If there is a \\""remember me\\"" command, I cannot find it in the set-up or help links. The new QB look and feel is better than ever, just as easy to use as before, with the added benefit of not having to use their server to electronically send invoices. Overall I'm pleased with the product, the timing was very bad and didn't allow for a planned purchase.

Camedia Master Pro 4.0,Software,3,3,5,N,N,"Better, but with bugs","I have version 2.0 for Mac and bought 4.0 pro so that my wife could have an easier time e-mailing photos. <br />The e-mailing utility works great, but it doesn't store mails you've sent for later review and it doesn't allow for easy viewing of pictures you're selecting for mailing.<br />The print feature also works much better, or at least it did until I treid using it under OS 9.2.2. Under OS X things worked fine, but I had to downgrade for other reasons and have been unable to print to my HP Photosmart ever since. Their tech support was not very supportive. Anyway, when it was working it made much more efficient use of paper and it allowed you to select photos from multiple different directories, unlike the previous version.<br />However, what I liked about the old version was that it was drag-and-drop friendly. It was easier to transfer files between directories this way, and so it is infinitely harder to organize photos under version 4.0. <br />Generally, it seems that whoever wrote the software wasn't completely familiar with Macs. A lot of the convenient and powerful shortcuts we Mac folks use are not served by this program.<br />If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy it. If they work out the above-mentioned bugs soon, though, then it's worth it.",12/17/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each level, the cities get bigger and bigger and pretty soon youre battling big jets dropping bombs on you as well. At one point you're attacking a small desert town with a drive in movie theater!!

Teach Me Blues Guitar,Software,5,1,1,N,Y,This CD-ROM Rocks!!!,"Great for beginners and intermediates! I purchased this cd-rom for a very fair price. Since downloading it and going through a few of the sections I find this simply amazing! First, I think Keith Wyatt is an excellent teacher, specifically via DVD. He appears throughout the sections of this cd-rom. Second, this cd-rom has EVERYTHING! If you're into the blues and learning how not only to play but where the playing derived from, this is definitely for you. You can go to specific riffs and then click on icons to get the lowdown on scales, modes, etc... It tells you the history, the methods and the uses for everything. Awesome! This program has a virtual fretboard that you can slow/speed as it plays. It loops and sections off whatever parts you feel you need to look at again. It shows actual videos of Wyatt playing or teaching as well as computerized methods. There's too much to list as to what this can do for you. I love it already and I've hardly delved into the meat of it all. What I like so far is that this cd-rom teaches you what the blues is. If you want to pick up a guitar and become a rock and roll god overnight this is not for you. But if you want to learn a little something about the heart and soul of The Blues this is definitely a fantastic tool for your blues education and training. I highly suggest paying the small price for something like this. It's fun and, if you take the time, can really teach you some great things on the guitar.",5/28/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TurboTax Deluxe 2002,Software,1,22,24,N,N,Won't run under Win4Lin.

Many reviewers mentioned the problem with product activation that prevents you from filing amended returns if you or the IRS decides you need to. That alone makes TurboTax completely unsuitable for use. A second problem I haven't seen mentioned is that it will not run under Win4Lin (runs Windows applications under Linux) and I don't want to reboot to Windows-only just to run the tax software. But thank goodness I installed TurboTax only under the Win4Lin virtual Windows which I can rebuild fairly easily.

The Print Shop Professional 3.5 DSA,Software,4,6,6,N,N,Redemption! (rescued from my previous 2 star review),"Below is my original review (2 STARS). just days after this was posted and after hounding Encore and Broderbund (who make this software) SOMETHING HAPPENED! The tech team at Encore (Broderbund) just created an update to fix a glitch in their VERY big seler Print Shop Professional 3.5. The update is version 3.5.3 and it solves a number of issues including the hateful blurry \\""HEADLINE\\"" problem it was having until this latest. I just updated mine and checked it out... IT'S A FIX! So I raised my review to 4 out of 5 (it still has a few minor problems, but really... sort of trivial by comparison.).<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I was able to do so much with Broderbund's Print Master Platinum 12 and so disappointed when they ran that product line right into the wall.... for scrapbooking (almost exclusively). So much of what that software could do was lost and the newer version of --> [[ASIN:B00EXPSVJK Encore Software The Print Shop Professional 3.5]] was where those features ostensibly were expected to resurface. However...<br /> Nowhere in the documentation either on their own website (where I purchased this product) or as a disclaimer during the order process does it mention a fatal flaw that is present in all PSP 3.5 (Print Shop Pro 3.5) incarnations. EVEN the newest ones on disc - THE HEADLINE FEATURE IS UNUSABLE!! Yes all headlines when using this software are blurred and at times illegible That's right, they are selling an otherwise dandy piece of tech gear, but if you need the Headline Feature, you are S.O.L As a result of this tactical negligence, I spent the better part of today/last night trying to find a cure for the heasdline problem, A cure which, sadly, does not exist at present<br /> Oh, and don't bother with the 3.5.2 \\""update\\"" . That too, does NOT work. A fact that has been acknowledged only in their pro user forums, the last words on which are to use another program to design a headline, save it as a JPG file and use it AS A GRAPHIC!... ..Unfortunately, it must be said, The PSP 3.5 is a bona-fide P.O.S.",4/19/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Family Tree Maker Deluxe [OLD VERSION],Software,5,1,1,N,Y,Wonderful Product!,I was rather concerned when I read some of the reviews about the Family Tree Maker.

She explained when I load the disc into my computer if it is one of the earlier 2012 versions a message will pop up saying you must update. I did that and it downloaded my ancestry family trees beautifully and quickly. (I do have one terabyte of storage.) I made sure to register when prompted and that did grant me the free three month subscription to the U.S. search records. I wanted the family treemaker so I will still be able to view all of the original source documents when my three month subscription is over.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 [OLD VERSION],Software,3,49,59,N,N,Good concept but poor implementation...,"I've been using Photoshop Element and Album since 1.0. <br /> <br />Contrary to what you may think, PE 3 is NOT Album 2.0 bundled with the image editor. It is one huge app with different intrinsic components: editor and browser. <br /> <br />Album 2.0 was good enough for my needs (pics and video clips cataloguing) but lacked a critical feature: watched folders (found in Picasa and ACDSEE). PE 3 has this feature, thus my decision to upgrade. <br /> <br />Below are the major issues I've been having with PE 3 are: <br />====================================== <br />1- Video clips catalog is busted: only small clips are recognized while Sony 640x480 30fps clips show up as broken thumbnails. This worksd fine with Album 2.0. <br /> <br />2- Because of the above problem, the Browser is extremely slow to the point to appear being frozen. I had no choice but to disable 'Video' as an authorized media type...This alone is a showstopper for me. <br /> <br />3- Sluggish performance: launching and switching between editor and browser is slow (I have a P4 2G, 768MB RAM, nVidia GeForce ti 4200 with 64MB video card, WinXP Pro SP2) <br /> <br />If I wanted to catalog pics only, I'd use Miocrosoft Digital Suite, which is by far the faster app, not to mention the EXIF support wich is awesome (keywords are actually saved in the picture itself!) <br /> <br />Now because I need to tag video clips and pics, I'll be buying ACDSEE v.7.0. My friend ahs it and it is a great product: fast, video, pics and music cataloging. Their keywords is using a tree-like structure which is not as elegant as Adobe's tagging mechanism, but I'll live... <br /> <br />Hope that review helps. <br />p.s.

Corel Painter X3,Software,4,3,3,Y,N,Top-notch painting program - but no vector support,"I've been playing around with this app for the last month and have found that it fits solidly in that space between photo-editing software and full-fledged graphics design software.<br /><br />What I mean by that statement is that this software offers a lot of creative capability - far more than an application like [[ASIN:B00EOQZB0A Adobe Photoshop Elements]]. Having said that, the additional capabilities come at the cost of increased complexity & cost, which means most casual users won't even consider it.<br /><br />In our case, we were considering using Painter instead of the full-blown [[ASIN:B007USG3OC Adobe Photoshop]]. All-in-all, this is an excellent replacement; but, it turns out that X3 does not support vector graphics. It won't even open existing vector files - which is a deal breaker for us.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that Painter X3 has a good interface and a lot of potential for people who want to move to the 'next level' when it comes to digital creativity. As long as you don't need vector support, I suspect this will fit the bill perfectly.",10/11/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 32bit (Full) System Builder DVD 1 Pack,Software,5,0,0,N,Y,Wonderful from the start to the finish,"Great Price - was able to redeem my discover card cash back to get even more bang for the buck<br /><br />Free Shipping with Tracking - Nothing beats it<br /><br />On Time Delivery - Makes it very satisfying to get it on time ( after going through a wait of 2 weeks to receive the same software from another on line merchant, and not hearing from them or being able to contact them that led to canceling the order via my credit card, the importance of on time delivery becomes paramount)<br /><br />Software - Perfect! that is what I was looking for. Everything went off well - from the installation to the the actual performance.

Final Draft 9,Software,2,8,10,N,N,"More bugs than a bag of bugs, with a side of bugs, with an order of bugs to go. (Windows 8)","I love the idea of Final Draft, more than I ever actually liked final draft itself. I started in this game using CELTX because it was free, I love the collaboration ability, the online nature of the sharing facility, then the scheduling and the storyboard features, aaaaah the good ole' days.<br /><br />But, just like the 'Apple' ideology, you just seem to have to have FD if you want to get on in this world. But for the actual tiny program you get it is full of issues, Ver. 9 crashes all the time, older scripts almost NEVER open properly, the workarounds are laughable (seriously, a release version software that needs workarounds??) and the whole &#34;what version is this?&#34; question that professionals have to ask each other now is utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />The size of this thing should run on a PC from the 90's, let alone on a quad core beast I currently use.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact that the industry almost 'requires' you have this dinosaur, I know most would use something else.<br /><br />With version 9 they've really hit a Windows Vista moment, they fixed what wasn't broke, I think their time is coming to an end and they have literally shot themselves in the foot.<br /><br />This morning an older draft of a script froze my work machine for about 30 minutes at which point I had to restart, and whilst typing a moment ago I looked up and the damned thing is about ten words behind (and I'm no speed typist I can tell you!)<br /><br />Buggy, slow, almost no changes in the latest version that haven't been available for a decade in other FREE utilities, and for the price I think they should have done so much better, they have a massive fanbase that will halve with this new mess.<br /><br />I think another day or two of this and I'm off back to version 8.",3/28/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate,Software,2,0,1,Y,N,Be careful with this one!,"If you've seen this program in use and you know in advance what you will be getting, and that's what you want, then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, exercise extreme caution. It is very powerful and capable. But it is also a very complex piece of software and not easy to learn. I tried it, decided it was several light-years beyond what I wanted, and chose to uninstall it.<br /><br />And that's when the fun started.<br /><br />Pinnacle installs about a dozen different applications when you run its installer. But when you run its uninstaller, it removes only the base application and leaves everything else on your disk--gigabytes worth of software. It took me an entire afternoon with Revo Uninstaller to get my PC back to where it had been beforehand. I had to find all the apps Pinnacle had installed, remove them one by one, and then remove *hundreds* of registry entries and *hundreds* of directories that each app's uninstaller failed to deal with. It was a nightmare and I'm still wondering what I might have missed and what will now fail to work because I deleted something I shouldn't have. It was an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />I would recommend that if you decide on installing this, that you first create a Windows Restore point. Then, choose the \\""Custom\\"" install and just do the Pinnacle application itself. If you want all the other add-ons and libraries and tools, you can add them later, and if you decide to uninstall, you'll have a much easier time than I did.",9/4/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pixelmator [Old Version],Software,3,2,3,N,Y,Pixelmator vs Aperture,"I love my Mac and while iPhoto is an awesome program there seem to always be some images that need a little more editing. So, I had a choice of 2 products that I liked. I purchased Pixelmator and while it does a lot of things and can get very involved I was not personally pleased with the software. Seems it is more of a creative tool than a photo editing tool - my opinion. So, I have since purchased Aperture 3 and do prefer it to Pixelmator. The flow of Aperture 3 with iPhoto seems a better match as well. So, download the free trial of Pixelmator before buying as well as the free trial of Aperture 3. Yes, I know Aperture 3 is more expensive but it is an Apple product and again - if you are OK with spending a little more I think you will be happier with Aperture 3 than Pixelmator. Also, the support with Pixelmator was less than good. No response to the 2nd email sent after attempting to do something suggested to me by their support.",2/18/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roxio Easy VHS to DVD [Old Version],Software,4,5,5,N,Y,Works for me,"I installed it on a Windows 7 laptop that is less than a year old. The software install went fine. I plugged in the included USB device and Windows installed the driver. Based on other reviews I asked the software to get updates. There weren't any. I fired up the VHS, selected the edit button because I want to save the videos to a hard drive. I can always burn them to DVD later. I started the capture and saved a 40 minute video to disk. it took about 2.5 gig of disk space. I did stop most other applications and did nothing on the laptop while the recording completed. I read most of the other reviews posted for this product. I have an idea why some folks may have had so much trouble with it. This kind of application can be CPU intensive and if folks were trying to do almost anything else on a typical PC they probably caused enough interrupts that the software just gave up trying to process the incoming tape stream and burn it to DVD at the same time.

Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack [OLD VERSION],Software,4,204,212,N,Y,Want a professional quality editor - Sony Vegas is your choice.,"I researched movie editors for months, before buying Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack. Did I make the right choice? Yes, however this product is only usable if you have good general computer skills, and have the ability to learn through trial and error. I would not recommend this product if you expect to produce a masterpiece in one day.<br />What do you get in this package?<br />Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9 - program to edit digital movie, add soundtracks, voice-overs, and fancy text, rolling credits, etc.<br />DVD Architect Studio - program to author DVD's, so you end up with professional quality DVD menus with all the bells and whistles<br />Sound Forge Audio Studio - a music editing program, with the added ability to convert all your L.P.'s and cassettes into digital format, so that you can then make CD's or load them onto your IPod.<br />Cinescore Studio 1.0 - free music of various genres, to add to your productions to give them a professional sound<br /><br />There was one major problem with this software when I first loaded it, that I only managed to fix by pure luck. The problem was quite a major one. In the version which comes on CD-ROM, there is a bug which stops the soundtrack from MPEG2 files from loading into the editior program. This is incredible considering that almost every digital camcorder on the market uses the MPEG2 format, including Sony. However!!! Once you have loaded the program and registered, you need to go to the Sony update software web page. Here you will find a download that fixes many bugs in the program, including the MPEG2 problem.<br />There is another problem with the program if you are going to buying this to upload videos to You Tube. In the last couple of months You Tube has upgraded there video screen to Widescreen (16:9 ratio) format. There is no template in Vegas Movie Studio to handle this. So if you intend on uploading video to You Tube in 16:9, then you will need some advanced computer skills to create your own template. I'm sure Sony will work on this and provide an update to the program in time. At the moment, the program handles traditional 4:3 format for upload to the internet.<br /><br />There are many cool features hidden within Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack. Only the basics are discussed in the instructional booklets that come with the program. If you explore all the alien like buttons and features, through trial and error, you will be more than happy with this software.<br />6/10 for ease of use<br />9.5/10 for cool features<br />All the best with your movie editing and DVD production.<br />Regards D.<br /><br />UPDATE AS OF 28th JUNE 2010<br />GREAT NEWS!!!!<br />Sony Creative Software has just released a brand new version of the software featured in this review.<br />The NEW VERSION is called Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 Production Suite.<br />All the bugs that I had reported in the above review have now been FIXED!

I have the Adobe CS5 Master Suite, and in spite of the fact that it costs about 70 times as much, and is much more likely to be pirated, it does not seem to have these activation problems.

Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 Student and Teacher Edition [OLD VERSION],Software,2,0,0,N,Y,"May be best suited for YOUR needs, but not for mine.","I found Adobe Photoshop Elements to be much better suited to my needs AND easier to use based on my experience and amateur familiarity with older versions of Photoshop. I needed a newer version of Photoshop to be able to handle the &#34;raw&#34; images from my then new Canon EOS T3i. I read many, many reviews of both Lightroom and Elements written by amateurs and professionals. To be honest, it was difficult for me to understand the difference between the two software packages. My son-in-law is comfortable with Lightroom and uses it well, so I tried it. I found it to be vastly different from previous generations of the full Photoshop software. Even after trying it, I am not certain I understand the differences. The major difference MAY BE that Lightroom allows across the board corrections and modifications over many images at once, whereas Elements allows image by image manipulation. Without extensive reading, study and tutorials, I had difficulty figuring out how to work on a single image at a time with Lightroom. I did use Lightroom successfully to create a slide show fairly easily. But this can be done with several software packages.<br /><br />In the end, I uninstalled and sold Lightroom and replaced it with Elements 11.",8/29/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm addicted.,"Having had the same experience with Rosetta Stone as many of the reviewers here have described, I went in search of an alternative program that would give me the tools to say more than \\""The horse runs\\"" and \\""The man eats rice\\"" (Rosetta Stone is quite enjoyable, but better for vocab than for anything you can actually utilize in real life). I came across Fluenz, tried out the online demo and was hooked. I was amazed at the amount of info that stuck, even after one lesson. I completed level one in 3 weeks, which is probably faster than recommended, however, I looked forward to working on the lessons each day, and often had to stop myself from doing too many lessons at a time. I'm now in the middle of Level 2 and I'm starting to think in French. I'm often surprised at the number of structures I can put together (OK, some faster than others). The program is structured so that each lesson builds on the last and the explanations during the tutorial sessions are invaluable. Additional practice sessions on the audio CD's and podcasts help to further hammer the information into your brain. There's also a Facebook page that allows you to communicate with other Fluenz users and an additional site called the \\""Fluenz Commons\\"", where newly developed flashcards are available. iPhone and iPad apps are on the way. I haven't needed to contact customer service, but based on other reviews, it's great. And no, I don't work for Fluenz. Just a very happy customer. If you're hesitating to purchase this, don't. It's the best $500 I've spent recently. Fluenz is a sleek, effective program, and most importantly, if you have realistic expectations and are willing to put in the time and effort required, it works.",3/14/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The import fails the same way PSE9 did. Because I can't use the Organizer at all, I only use Photoshop Elements as a photo editor and use Google's free Picasa program as my organizer.

Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac,Software,5,0,0,N,Y,"Excellent Windows XP, 7 and 8 virtualization","I have been using Parallels 8 on my new Macbook Pro (the June 2012 model, dual core i5 processor) for over a month now, and have had exactly zero problems so far. I didn't expect this because I used to run Parallels 6 on an older Intel iMac in the past and that gave me nothing but trouble (horrible performance being problem number 1). Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8 all run on my Macbook Pro as they should. The reason I decided to give Parallels 8 a try is because of its supposed higher speed and stability over VMware 5 and previous versions of Parallels.<br /><br />Windows 8 is speedy enough on my machine that games from 2003-2005 run effortlessly in a 1600*1200 resolution, as well as various more serious applications. Applications that I frequently run in Parallels are:<br />- both \\""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\\"" games (run great but Parallels GPU emulator doesn't support AA or buffer effects)<br />- \\""Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines\\"" (runs flawlessly with the latest unofficial patch from the Patch Scrolls)<br />- MS Office Visio 2010<br />- Several password cracking algorithms (can be quite CPU-intensive)<br />- Several computer forensics applications, such as ProDiscover.<br />- Skyrim and Fallout 3 (were playable at a mix of the lowest and medium settings, don't expect to complete a round of Skyrim or Fallout 3 on a virtualized machine)<br /><br />The Coherence mode works very well, I love using it for running programs with smaller user interfaces like ProDiscover. While in Coherence, you can run individual Windows programs in full-screen, which gives them their own Mac OS Desktop (accessible through \\""CTRL\\"" + \\""up arrow\\""), and which also enables you to flick through your Windows apps with a three-fingered swipe like you would in Mac OS 10.8.<br /><br />Finally, I should note that my Macbook Pro contains 16 GB of memory and uses a Corsair Force GT solid state drive, but Parallels ran on my notebook without issues before I performed these upgrades. It's also pretty clear that you would need at *least* 4 GB of memory to run a virtualized Windows 8 instance on top of Mac OS, and you'll find that having anywhere over 4 gigabytes makes a world of difference.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend Parallels 8! The only thing I miss is the ability to enable anti-aliasing in video games, but that is of no consequence anyway.",12/10/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Borland Delphi 5 Standard (New user),Software,5,5,5,N,N,Best tool in the market,"Delphi is the best all around tool i've used. You can do everything you can do in C++ and it's so easy. It's learning curve is almost the same one to learn Visual Basic. Delphi creates standalone executable without dlls, and your applications run since the first time like they are supposed to do. Ask anybody from VB to know the problems with VB.<br />You can create apps, web server extensions, dlls, ActiveX Objects and ActiveX dlls, Control Panel applets, your own controls and much more. You have tons of components, and you can get more tons of them for free at the web.<br />The standard version doesn't have database components, so you should get instead the Pro or Enterprise version, although you can import the MSADO library and use it the same way you use it at VB.<br />Delphi is what MS wants the .NET platform to be.<br />Highly recommended. It's sad that a lot of managers select VB without even considering other tools like Delphi, but if you know Delphi you will finish your projects before the others using VB and your app will run smoothly since the first time.",2/7/2001,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMSI FloorPlan 3D Home Design Suite Version 10,Software,4,51,54,N,N,IMSI FloorPlan 3D Advantage over Punch Architect 4000,"I own both the IMSI (FloorPlan 3D Version 5) and Punch (Architect 4000) software titles, and the following are my own conclusions. I have no vested interest in either manufacturer. I have a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering, and have taught interactive computer graphics, so I guess I am more than usually familiar with computers and design. <br /> <br />I designed my previous home using the IMSI package, and after using it to capture the design, I passed it along to a draftsman to create drawings for the permitting process. I found that the package was easy to use (although a bit weird), and that it generally worked great. When we moved in, the home was absolutely spectacular! So, when we moved to another state to retire, we decided to repeat the process. Even though I still had the IMSI software (Version 5) and it readily installed onto XP, I thought that surely there had been improvements. So, I took the time to find the \\""best package out there\\"". The reviews I read said that the Punch (Architect 4000) package was rated best, had the most features, blah, blah, blah. So I bought it, in spite of paying approximately 3X what I would pay for the latest IMSI version of FloorPlan 3D. The manual is about an inch thick, but I started wading through, thinking that this was the learning cost of a really good package. The manual seemed reasonable and there are TONS of features (read complexity), but when I actually tried to use the program, I couldn't get anything done. Everything was hard to do. Then, and this was the killer for me, whenever I saved data, I could never read the file back in. I tried everything, and eventually thought that it was my fault, so I went back to my old IMSI package because I had a house to design. <br /> <br />I quickly got up to speed because IMSI wins out hands down for its simple user interface. I struggled with both initially, but soon found that IMSI's wall layout tool, while weird, was useable. It's ease of use (tailorable wall heights, pushing even non-rectilinear wall segments around, changing wall thicknesses, immediate demonstration of dimensions and room square footage, changing wall and floor materials, colors, and texture, etc) allowed one to work pretty quickly. I was never able to use Punch's layout editor efficiently. Ever! Forget saving the data so you could work on a design again. Even just creating a simple layout was a huge struggle. Unless you knew the design beforehand, it was very difficult to lay out a floor plan interactively. This was what IMSI was good at. Even with a fully designed floorplan, I had trouble with the Punch program. <br /> <br />IMSI was also the easiest in viewing your design in 3D. Again, the viewing tools were weird and somewhat non-intuitive, but eventually useful. Punch's 3D viewer was totally useless, and I was never able to control the views, no matter what I did. And, \\""Hey!\\"", I taught computer graphics. <br /> <br />After spending many hours getting a complete design (from my working with IMSI) entered into a freshly-reloaded Punch, I again tried to save my work. When I went back to work on it some more, it was unreadable. The file was there, but there was some formatting error that made it unreadable. I was furious, but thankfully, I had the IMSI design captured. So, I had a decision- Waste more time trying to debug a program I had paid 3X more for than the IMSI FloorPlan 3D, or spend my time getting work done on my house plan. Actually, I downloaded a free upgrade to Version 5.1 and got busy. Now I am thinking of purchasing IMSI's Version 11 as I am finalizing our house plan and like some of the new features and abilities of the new software. <br /> <br />To be candid, neither software package was bug-free. IMSI occasionally doesn't allow you to move a wall, but that is almost always because there is some constraint that is disallowing the modification. I found Punch to be even more restrictive. While I was able to exportthe IMSI design as a vrml file and e-MAIL it to my son to review, Punch had the greatest number of export file options. Too bad it always lost my saved designs. Neither package really creates beautiful 3D graphics, but IMSI's simple renderings were adequate for previewing the design work. I also liked IMSI's design methods using internal room dimensions. But, neither program made it clear how to proceed in starting a design from scratch. Nowhere did they tell you whether you could design the 2nd floor first, whether you had to layout the foundation beforehand (Punch), etc. <br /> <br />Finally, I should mention that I wanted to input site information for my lot, but that was too costly in terms of time. Interestingly, I downloaded Google's free Sketchup software, imported my IMSI design (in dxf file format), and was able to place it on the terrain using a Sketchup to Google Earth tool, and then interactively view it in 3D on my 10 acre lot using Google Earth. I found out that I have some serious grading and fill work to do on the build site.",1/3/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 -Old Version,Software,3,104,113,N,Y,Caveat Emptor!!,"PSE8 for Mac is great for all the reasons covered by the previous reviewers. As a long time PS2 and PSE3 user, I have used these programs to generate stunning art work, which usually begins with my own photos and then utilization of a variety of brushes, plug-ins, styles. I have a hunch there are others 'out there' who have intuitively discovered the grand set of tools available in PS and PSE, who may appreciate the following discoveries (much to my dismay and disappointment) before making any kind of upgrade to this version. The bottom line (and this is after several correspondences with Adobe tech support) is that many of my precious plug-in's (Kai Power Tools and Xaos Terrazzo) DO NOT work with this version!! Also, although brush,shape and gradient files can be added (dropped into the appropriate folders), the styles files CANNOT be added!! Anyone who has worked extensively with styles will know how valuable they are! There is an assortment of 'canned styles' included, but if you go to the preset manager there is no longer even a drop down to select 'styles' as in other versions of PS and PSE!! If any of this is of significance to a reviewer, and helps to avoid making a hasty purchase, then I will feel a little better about my own hasty rush to upgrade. Will I use PSE8? Of course, but I will stay primarily though, with the earlier versions that allow free addition of styles and work with my precious plug-ins!

"TurboTax Premier Fed, Efile and State 2013",Software,2,1,1,N,N,DOESN'T HANDLE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CORRECTLY; OTHER SHORTCOMINGS,"I have used Turbo Tax since the early 2000' s (with one exception in 2006, when I used TaxCut) and have been somewhat satisfied. I just finished my taxes for 2013 (yes, it's late, but I have an extension to October 15) and find that for some reason, I have had significantly more issues with the 2013 version. Because of this, I need to mail in my return because TTax will not electronically file a return to the IRS if the taxpayer has overridden one of its entries. The foreign tax credit (FTC) component has a huge problem. A taxpayer is allow to claim the entire credit on Line 47 of Form 1040 if it is no more than $300 (single) or $600 (married). The taxpayer can claim the entire amount with no reduction. However, I have not been able to do this on TTax without performing an override because TTax generates a Form 1116 which performs some calculations which result in a reduction of the credit. It is true that Form 1116 does not have to be filed in this case; the problem is that the calculations are affecting the line item on the 1040. The result is that I cannot file this return online. Another shortcoming on TTax Premier is that there is insufficient direction for properly filling out limited partnership information that a taxpayer might receive for, say, holding shares in a MLP (a real possibility if the taxpayer is an income investor). The MLP's Form 1065 has a plethora of information in the \\""Statement\\"" section, but much of it cannot be entered into TTax. One final problem: TTax does not download a number of brokerage 1099's. It does this for the more popular brokers (such as Schwab, which downloaded with no problems), but does not do so for Interactive Brokers or Options House. That meant all th e sales have to be hand-entered. These brokerages do not provide sales information in a friendly format, so it can be a bear to have to enter this information manually.",9/18/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PowerDirector 9 Ultra - 64,Software,5,0,0,Y,N,"Really, really fun to use.","I'm not sure my four year old computer has all the highest system requirements, but the software works great and has a really nice interface. I was initially impressed with the quality of the appearance (nice layout and color choices, like Adobe's pretty logo) and straighforward option titles, but the real beauty is in the output. I installed the software, a ten minute process, and within two hours had an amazing slideshow, using most of the automated options, to use for my daughter's grad party. The user's guide is great. I read all the instructions for making a slideshow while it was installing. It was easy to figure out the steps because every time your mouse hovers over an option, it tells you what that option does. Love that. I was able to import video from my Panasonic HDC-TM55 and my Flip HD camera with no issues. The magic movie option is really, really fun if you don't need to be hands-on and picky about each scene's length or the transitions. I love the idea of 'rooms,' such as the media room, effect room, title room, etc. You know where to go for just what you want to do. The Title room is my favorite because I've been so frustrated with that aspect in other software, like Adobe's Premiere Elements. Making titles in Microsoft's old version of Movie Maker was quite easy, but also quite limited. This is just as easy as Movie Maker, but it's pretty much unlimited in my opinion. You can make titles as easy or complex as you like. I will never use all the options available, but will enjoy the ones I do use. I would suggset this software is best for people who are familiar with video editing software. Beginners should try to download an old version of Movie Maker and stick with that for a while.",6/20/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on my latest experience, I will NEVER purchase another Norton product. I installed NIS 2013 shortly after upgrading to Windows 8. NIS 2013 simply doesn't work with Windows 8. I started having problems downloading emails, then problems installing program/app updates. I suspected NIS might be a problem, so I disabled the software. Then I couldn't re-establish NIS. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the NIS, same problems as before. While on the phone with Norton tech support, my computer crashes and I can't recover. They tell me to call Microsoft tech support. Windows recovery disk also doesn't work. MS also can't help, short of telling me to wipe my computer clean, then reinstall Windows 8. Finally, I was able to uninstall NIS while in Safe Mode. By the way, Windows 8 comes with Anti-Virus (which both Norton and MS failed to mention to me).

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011 [Old Version],Software,3,0,0,N,N,Additional State Return Very Expensive,"Because one \\""employer\\"" who should be paying me as a subcontractor (I really am self employed) deducts taxes in whatever state you work in (almost all of my work is out of state, and my other W-2 clients deduct my residential state tax or none at all) I have to file more than one state return. This was my first year with Turbo Tax since 2006 tax year. The first state return is included in the Home & Business software and is free. When I went to do the second state return, TurboTax wanted to charge me $39.95. I thought that a bit much and went poking around their website (not designed to get you human interaction very swiftly). The TurboTax \\""chat\\"" person told me second state return is $19.95 had I bought the CD version. I explained I downloaded the software from amazon.com (after all it is 2012, and aren't CD's becoming obsolete for software?). He had me uninstall TurboTax, and download a new copy, promising I would be charged $19.95 for 2nd state return. I opened the new download, and it was still $39.95. Ultimately, he gave me the 2nd state return for free. I would have been happy with $19.95 and it did take 45 minutes to get to our conclusion, but free is free. Note that when filling out the state return, the interview asked if I had \\""high deductible\\"" health plan. I said yes, knowing that those premiums were already deducted from federal AGI as Self Employed Health Insurance Deduction (SEHID). TurboTax leads me to deduct the health insurance premiums a second time, from AGI, even though the state return gets its info from the TurboTax fed return. I'm waiting for TurboTax tax rep to get back to me on that. I'm sure its an error in TurboTax, and have seen similar double deduction last year in H&R Block software - ironic that it was health insurance premium as well. I have to buy the expensive Home & Business version because I file a Schedule C. Yet it still seems the software is designed for someone in a less complex situation, one employer, period.",3/20/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QuickBooks Pro 2011 - [Old Version],Software,5,8,9,N,Y,LOVE QUICKBOOKS!!,"I have used Quickbooks since 1996. Before this version I was using Pro 08 and got caught in the forced upgrade. I am a creature of habit and hate change. BUT can you imagine using the QB from 1996 in 2011? Even though I gripe, whine and complain I know that in the end the upgrade, for the most part, is for the better. I purchased Pro 11 off amazon last week when it was only $99, happy about that. I completed my work for the week and started Fri morning with my install. Some of the reviews on here really scared the heck out of me so I was prepared for a long, tear filled stressful day. I am happy to report that my install could not have been better. Took about 30 minutes and I was up and running. I even got a signature scanned for paychecks & I am working on the logo to get it just right. Everything is exactly how it was and I have no complaints with this new product. This comment is for the QB people on here - one thing that changed from the 2006 to the 2008 version and is the same in 2011 that I am not happy with is in Customers & Jobs. We are in construction. I will have a developer that we do several jobs for, those jobs will have several phases, so it will be at lease 3 teired. In 2006 I could add Developer, right click and add job (job name & info) then right click on that and add phase (job # with phase #). I used to be able to have each phase with a different \\""ship to\\"" without having to add a million different ship to addresses. You guys should look at how that was in 2006 and make it like that again. That is probably the only thing I would change in QB.",3/4/2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During those months, people even started writing their own code fixes to restore functionality that had been broken.

It was effectively painless.<br /><br />I didn't use the support - but other reviews provide glowing reviews which I suspect are founded based on the well thought-out software.<br /><br />This is a good DIY tool for straightforward estate planning: probably 90+ percent of estates.

ACD Systems FotoSlate 4.0,Software,3,1,1,N,N,The potential to be great,"ACD Systems FotoSlate 4 has the potential to be a really great piece of software. Unfortunately it falls short for my use. Perhaps if you want a single document with different layouts for each page and are going to do a lot of adjustments by hand then this will be just the thing for you. What I was hoping for was the ability to take a large number of images and put them on multiple pages, either 6 or 12 per page, with the images scaled and rotated properly and with the file name as the caption. It looks like the software is supposed to do that but it doesn't. There is an option to \\""auto-rotate images\\"" but it either rotates all images (even those that didn't need to be rotated) or it doesn't rotate any. So, all images are printed in either vertical or horizontal orientation, rather than the appropriate orientation for the individual images. It is possible to manually rotate those images that are wrong but it's impossible to select multiple images so you have to do it one image at a time. That's quite time consuming when you have hundreds or thousands of images to rotate. Although the ACD Systems web site has user forums and there is a link to submit technical questions, they seem to be either broken or simply abandoned and not actually in use. There are recent posts in the forums for other products but not for Fotoslate. Once registered you'd think I could post to the forum but that feature seems to be broken. It's too bad, really.

I'm going to try to return it to amazon. It will not download my retirement account data. I've even tried uninstalling the program and reinstalling it. Nothing helps. It downloaded my bank checking and savings accounts just fine, but for my retirement accounts at one brokerage firm, it downloads the account numbers but shows a zero balance in each of them. At another brokerage firm, it downloaded one of my three accounts (and that one incorrectly--it showed the balance in securities and also in cash, showing double the correct balance), but won't download anything, even the account #'s, of the other two accounts at this firm. It's like those two don't exist. When I log into both these brokerage houses outside of Quicken, my info shows correctly for all six accounts. I've tried to download these into Quicken multiple times, trying \\""brokerage\\"", \\""IRA\\"", \\""advanced\\"", etc. These are major brokerage firms, and I'm using Windows 7. I am ready to throw Quicken out the window!<br /><br />In fairness, it did download one mutual fund account correctly, but one out of seven isn't good enough.<br /><br />I have used Mint, and it downloads all of these accounts correctly, with no problem. It updated their balances today, correctly, and shows their transactions. I'm puzzled as to why Intuit's free program can do this, but their paid Deluxe program cannot.<br /><br />I am also disappointed and surprised to learn that it will not transfer my Mint data into Quicken. I had planned to delete my Mint account and start using Quicken, but Quicken just doesn't work for my retirement accounts. My reason for wanting to change is that I'm just not comfortable having all my log-in information stored on Mint's servers.<br /><br />Edit: I've just printed the return label. I'm pleased that amazon allows returns of software.",2/12/2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Seuss Preschool,Software,2,0,0,N,N,Does not work well on XP if at all,"This game unfortunatly might be unstable for some windows XP. I bought this game years ago for my first child when we had windows 95 and it was wonderful!! She loved it and it was a great teaching tool. But when we upgrated to XP, everytime when I tryed to play it, it would just shut my computer down. I was excited when I ordered this one because I thought that it had been updated for XP but apparently it was not because when I recieved it, it does the same thing. It might work on some XP's, I'm not sure but I know it does not work on mine. I hate it, because I so wanted to use it for my other daughter who is 3 years old.",10/2/2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adobe GoLive 6.0 Upgrade [Old Version],Software,5,4,4,N,N,"Truly improved, powerful with the new Web Workgroup Server!!","I stepped over GoLive a few years back, don't remember which version, but didn't get into it then.<BR>I decided to get into it now during version 5 however, with the free upgrade to version 6, since I couldn't be bothered waiting for it to reach the market!<BR>However the user-friendlyness has been improved a lot with GL6 and it is now not only a lot stronger and yes, slower, but also a bit easier to get around.<BR><BR>Oh, dear I forgot to mention the diagrams when I submitted this review the first time!! They have appered to me as the best thing yet with GL - just because I find them very useful. When you first start a site up (you can do it later too of course), you have the ability to create a site diagram, OK that might not be that revolutionary.. What is so great about them is that you can create them with different symbols from the objects palette; database, PDF, page etc and once you've set them up GL actually creates a site with all the pages you've specified in the diagram. Further more you can show the diagram as a PDF or SVG file to your client online! Of course you can use the diagram as a reference throughout the design process.<br />I was recommended GL years ago by fellow webdesigners in London who told me that it would be good for me since I don't know html and that way I would learn it. My London co-workers couldn't have been more right - I have learnt a lot since I've gotten GL and I am still learning. Now with version 6 I also find that I am learning ASP, JSP etc as well and I mean I learn it practically, there is only so much you can read yourself to!!<br />Web Workgroup Server 1.0 that comes with this version is also something that I've started to enjoy, especially with consideration to that it now makes it a whole lot easier for me and my collegues worldwide to check pages etc in and out of a website, without me having to do, way too much supervising either - it saves time for me and that is valuable!!<BR>It's got a weblog with it, but I stillhaven't been able to figure out whether or not that shows who has been trying to log into the server and who had problems, or who got in straight away.<BR>The other bad thing is that I was reading the instructions for how to set it up and while I was doing that, I missed the few seconds I had to change the \\""system\\"" and \\""password\\"" -> I found myself locked out of the server and the only way I saw, was that I had to re-install the whole thing and fill in the password before time-out. That was annoying, but of course it is very likely that I missed something, since I had to do that, considering the server is a whole new program and part of GL..<BR> After I got in, it was however fairly straight forward to configure the website, publishing server and users.<BR>I find that Adobe is best for me since there are so many resources over at Adobe Studio for one, you can find free actions and new templates and just get so many great ideas from other users on how to do things quickly. It's great because there is so many ppl around who you can ask for help if you need it.",6/5/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mixman Studio Pro 4.0,Software,1,2,2,N,N,Stay away!,"Like the other reviewer from DeSoto, Texas said below, I too am experiencing crashes on a very robust installation of Windows XP. I am a hardware/software technician with over 10 years of field experience and I have a degree in Recording Engineering, yet, I cannot get this product to run on my system. I also have their DM2 mixer and used previous versions of their software on Win98 with no problems. I am hesitant to try their newer StudioXPro product fearing that it too will crash upon launch.<br />They really do have extremely poor support. They did NOT respond to any of my SEVEN e-mails regarding this problem. The only way to contact them is via e-mail. I even considered knocking on their doors when I last visited San Francisco, but their website only shows a PO BOX!<br />Until they get their act together, avoid MixMan. It's too bad too because they have a promising product line. They just don't know how to run a software company.",4/27/2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Toast 11 Titanium Pro Mac,Software,2,0,0,N,N,CD audio is Great...Conversion horrid,"I have Mac OSX Lion and have used Toast for years with my macs. I talked myself into buying the Toast 11 Pro (I had Toast 10) because I really needed to convert my old family Super 8's that I had transferred years ago into my external drive digitally.<br />I had several (5) DVD-R's that would only convert 1/2 of the DVD-R digitally to ANY file format. I tried several times with several conversion formats with the same result: 1/2 of the DVD-R. The pre-process conversion would read that the entire DVD-R would transfer; but only 1/2 would actually convert. Iy did not matter if the DVD=R was 2 hours long or 45 minutes...only 1/2 was converted.<br /><br />I finally had some DVD-Rs from the late 1990's of family that had audio as well as video as they were recorded originally on Hi -8 and put onto DVD-R.<br />These converted video OK to .mov files, but there were 2 second audio sync problems on the finished conversions. I tried several times with different formats--SAME PROBLEM. Unacceptable!<br />I purchased another program and I have had no problems with all of the situations listed above.<br /><br />As far as CD audio burning...the Toast 11 program is great...but any older Toast can do that! No need to upgrade.<br /><br />If you are going to burn CD's and/or Data files to CD or DVD/Bluray--I am sure that Toast 11 Pro will work fine for you. For Conversions: Toast 11 falls flat and short of expectations. School Grade: D+ and a lot of extra \\""Re-do\\"" work for me.",1/2/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I took my time studying what each function did and compared it PC Tools Registry Mechanic which is basically the same thing and activated only those utilities which matched it and the little meter quickly went all the way to the right. So far I have not experienced any of the problems listed by other users in terms of loss of passwords or loss of anything period!

Fate 1 2 3 Jewel Case,Software,3,36,40,N,Y,"Not what it appears, though it is what it is.","Greetings all.<br /><br />I purchased 'Fate: Jewel Case edition' believing I was purchasing Fate, Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) and Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul). It arrived on time and in good condition.<br /><br />I'm running the game on Windows 7. When I attempted to load and install the game my computer had a difficult time reading the disk. I eventually needed to resort to opening the game manually through Windows Explorer. Although the load was very slow, the game loaded successfully.<br /><br />At first look after installation it appeared I only had access to Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul). I became a touch irritated. Through the search process of looking for the first two Fate games I loaded a game storage site called \\""Wild Tangent,\\"" a site where an individual can pay and play older games. Fate was there as was Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) however, there was a charge to play either of the games, which between the two would have cost more than double what I paid for the Jewel Case edition of Fate. Now I am more than irritated. I figure its time to send a very nasty note to the folks I purchased the game from and I headed back to Amazon to let them know my feelings in very clear and concise words. Luckily for me, I didn't get that far.<br /><br />I choose to read through the reviews before giving in to my injured sense of fairness in the market place. First I read all the reviews of those who rated the game a 1. With a couple of exceptions in which the reviewer just wanted to hear him/herself rant, the reviewers experienced the same issue I did. I was feeling proud of myself now knowing I wasn't alone. However, there was a slight dent in my personal feelings of belonging to a disgruntled crowd. . . There were a whole lot more folks who rated the game 5 stars. Why that was, I decided I needed to find out.<br /><br />The first Five Star rating I read was written by Oddlydrawn. He explained how Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul) contains within itself the other two games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.<br /><br />So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago. :-)<br /><br />~Somewhere in the process of getting older, I forgot to grow up.~o games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.<br /><br />So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago. :-)<br /><br />~Somewhere in the process of getting older, I forgot to grow up.~",2/3/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate FULL VERSION [DVD] [OLD VERSION],Software,4,20,29,N,N,I love the new features - should have progressed more in 5 years,"I beta tested Vista from early on and have run the complete version for about 2 months now via TechNet and Microsoft Connect. I love how it works and runs. Only real argument I have is that I run it 64 bit with a dual core and some programs are not compatable (not Microsoft's fault.) They need to catch up! On another note, Microsoft released details of this OS a long time ago, yet kept dropping features (new file system...) to get to an earlier release date.

Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 9 [OLD VERSION],Software,1,3,5,N,Y,Read before you buy!!!!,"Before you buy this software read all of Amazon's reviews, and the user forums @ Roxio. This software is riddled with bugs, causes serious system crashes, and incredible frustration. Read Roxio's workaround for the problems before you install this, because if it crashes your computer, you're going to be spending a day or two manually cleaning your registry. <br /> <br />The problems mostly seem to happen when upgrading from previous versions. I have used, and loved, Roxio since version 5, and have upgraded to every version since then with little or no difficulty. But when I upgraded from 8 to 9 all hell broke loose. Major crashes, not just of the OS, but other software. Incredibly hard time uninstalling Roxio 9. Thought I would have to do a clean install of Windows to get my system back, but after several attempts at deleting all Roxio references in the registry, and then doing a \\""system restore,\\"" I got the OS stabile again. But this took about twelve hours to accomplish, and because of the system restore rollback, I had to redo a lot of work. <br /> <br />Save yourself some some aggrevation: READ BEFOR YOU BUY!

I previously had Hallmark Christian Studio 2 Deluxe and it was very 'user friendly'. There were many styles to choose from and you were able to be very creative. I spent hours going through these cards and there no 'pretty' cards. The majority of them were like cartoon drawings - not something I would send to an older adult. The messages inside were 'fluff' and though I knew it was not a Christian Card program, I did expect there would perhaps be some religious selection in the Christmas section. I was wrong. It was actually work in choosing a card and some of them, even in the Preview mode, were unreadable. You had to click all over the place to open, see inside, and close each card. All in all, with a choice of thousands of cards, I didn't find enough to even bother with keeping the product. (I misplaced my disc for my other program.)I spent weeks in deciding which program to get and went with the Hallmark name and my experience with the previous product I had been so happy with.

Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0 [Old Version],Software,4,6,7,N,Y,Partition software for dual-boot (WinXP & Vista),"Having purchased Vista, but wishing to keep Windows XP MCE, I purchased Acronis Disk Director Suite 10 in order to set up a dual boot system that would accommodate both operating systems. In addition to the Acronis product I also had a copy of Norton Partition Magic, and since I had two identical desktop PCs to configure in a dual-boot mode I intended to use Acronis on one and Norton on the other. After a few hours of Symantec software torture I abandoned the Norton product, and easily configured both PCs using the Acronis Disk Director. I have yet to figure out why Norton Partition Magic would not step through the dual boot configuration process, but Acronis Disk Director 10 sailed right through without a hitch. I have been using Norton products for years, and while Symantec makes quality software they also engineer their product line with a sufficient number of traps to drive even the most patient geek certifiably mad. You may ask why Disk Director did not get the 5-star rating; the answer is that Acronis has a few unnecessary traps of its own (but not quite enough to coax you into using the software as a frisbee) So, if I ever have the occasion to again set up a PC to accommodate two operating systems (dual-boot), and the software choices are between Acronis and Norton, I will not hesitate to purchase Disk Director; I highly recommend this software.",5/7/2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learn Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 by Video,Software,5,0,2,Y,N,Excellent way to learn Lightroom,"I was extremely pleased with this training video. The video player was very full featured; far better than any I have used in other video training I have used. Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.) It will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too. The Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book. The DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled \\""The Photograper's Eye\\"" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good,although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD. I have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with \\""What's New in LR3\\"" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings. If you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit. All you bookmarks are available from one of the tabs at the top... a really nice feature! If you truly are a Lightroom beginner, this DVD will get you up-and-running quickly. If you have used Photoshop, and Camera Raw (CR) in particular, you will quickly see how adjustments in LR are so similar to CR, with LR adding so much more in terms of automation, asset management etc. Quirky start-up aside, this is an easy 5 star rating!",9/27/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teacher's Toolbox 6.0,Software,5,8,8,N,N,Recommended by a colleague,"I read a previous review but find my experience to be much different. Perhaps due to the fact that I was not a user of a previous version. I was introduced to the product by a colleague. After she reviewed with me the features of the product, I decided to purchase for myself. I have found that that there is very little learning curve to begin using the product effectively. The navigation is easy and the accuracy of reporting, averaging and curving is excellent.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 - Old Version,Software,1,28,39,N,N,Very Upset & Disappointed,"Received this quite promptly from Amazon.com. Though I have Jasc PSP v8 I was looking for a certain (and, supposedly, superfast) format that was, reportedly, very easy to use with Photoshop Elements. When I tried to load photoshop Elements to my laptop (which is a little over a year old) it crashed my hard drive. After several futile attempts to fix the problem myself (was unable to even start the computer as it was in a crazy loop that wouldn't allow attempts at loading it up in safe mode even) I had to take it in to be looked at. <br /> <br />Techs were unable to find which exact file was corrupt (after several hours there were 100s) so they eventually did a system restore. So, added to the cost of the software I was also $170 out of pocket. Techs loaded Adobe so I wouldn't have a similar problem. I loaded all my other software without too much trouble. Had to remove their version of Norton. <br /> <br />Anyway, though I am able to use Adobe for the purpose for which it was purchased I am not happy with the software. It freezes. It is super slow when it's not freezing. I even have it open with nothing else running and it is still erratic. I HATE IT and it has cost me more money than I ever thought it would. <br /> <br />My advice is STEER CLEAR. Get Jasc's PSPA.",7/13/2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011 [Old Version],Software,3,1,1,N,Y,Good Product but don't like the price games,"I have used the three top programs TurboTax, Taxcut, and TaxAct over the years and tend towards TurboTax. The main reason I go to the other two is the price games TurboTax and Taxcut play. There is no substantive reward for using the program again the following year (yeah they offer you ten dollars off but you can get that by shopping on-line). I decided to buy on Amazon this year because I wanted to get it earlier. Just recently Costco but it on sale for another $10 cheaper.

VOCALOID2 Character Vocal Series 03: Megurine Luka (Japan Import),Software,5,1,2,N,Y,A superstar voice-bank,"This library is a Vocaloid 2 collection of the Luka Megurine voice bank. It is packaged together with the Vocaloid 2 Editor and if that is OK then there is no need to buy the Vocaloid 3 Editor (you can make the editor use English text by installing it, find the file &#34;VOCALOID2_Japanese.dll&#34; and remove it or change it to another name).<br /><br />Luka is able to sing in Japanese and in English, with a nice soft voice and a good note-span. She can be easily imported to the Vocaloid 3 Editor (provided that you activate the voice bank first). There is a comprehensive manual included with the library - but unfortunately it is only in Japanese. Installation is straightforward, but is is in Japanese so it is a good idea to find some instructive youtube-videos to guide you. Also remember that the voice-bank must be activated and de-activated if it has to be move to another computer.",3/8/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H&R Block Taxcut 2006 Home & Business + State,Software,4,15,19,N,N,Bought this for S Corp,"According to reviews of TurboTax's Home and Business, it appears that TurboTax does not support S Corp (but probably does in the more expensive copr. package). Since many small businesses are S Corps, you probably will need to buy something besides TurboTax...like this program.<br /><br />That is why I bought this product...I checked the product homepage (taxcut_com) and it said<br /><br />\\""Complete Business Coverage - Helps you prepare returns for a number of business types, including Corporations, S Corporations, Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Non-profits and Estates & Trusts. Plus, the program handles Payroll Taxes as well.\\""<br /><br />So hopefully it will work for me without any additional software. I will try to come back and update this review once I try it out...but since it is from H&R Block, I figure it might not be the simplist program, but at least it will be accurate (they actually guarantees that...although most errors are from the users anyway).<br /><br />Nice little perk is that the software comes on a USB jumpdrive for easy installation...and it also will import TurboTax files from previous years...<br /><br />Sorry this review is not more informative, but after spending an hour digging around for S Corp info, I thought it would be helpful to mention that this apparently supports S Corp Businesses, as well as (unlimited) business state returns, personal federal and state as well as E-Filing... Overall it certainly seems to include alot of forms and features for one price.",12/26/2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Windows 10 Home USB Flash Drive,Software,1,33,50,N,N,"Terrible Invasion of Privacy, Terrible installer","UPSHOT: YOU TURN YOUR COMPUTER/DEVICE INTO BIG BROTHER BY AGREEMENT IN THE LICENSE AT INSTALLATION, IF YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 10. Never before in history has such a 'license' created such awful terms. Look in the comments for links so you can see the language for yourself. I can't put the links in an Amazon review.<br /><br />SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF PRIOR TO INSTALLATION, WHAT HITLERIAN TERMS YOU'RE AGREEING TO.<br /><br />Installation is also extremely glitchy. About 50% of the installers' reports I've read, are 'smooth', especially from Windows 8.1.. else, glitchy. Given the above warning, I spend a lot of time watching how people in tenforums, wilderssecurity forums, bleepingcomputer and even microsoft community, are suffering with installing this horrible new Windows 10. I do have it, but as an Insider. I write extensively about it in bleeping computer and vimeo PC World Alumni forum and brainout(dot)net frankforum (latter two are my own), so you can read more there. It has no confidential data on it, and the hard drive is removable.<br /><br />I personally own 16 Windows machines which are eligible for this thing 'free'. So obviously if I found it good, would get it for them all, and say so here.<br /><br />But Windows 10, is scary. First time, Windows is scary. You'll have to see it yourself to believe it: at least, I did. That's why I became an Insider, first.<br /><br />So here, I feel I owe it to my fellow Amazonians to disclose the upshot of this awful installer:<br /><br />1. It will only allow you to do a so-called 'inplace upgrade' ON TOP OF your current Window 7 or 8, which 50% of the time results in disaster. People do it, to keep their current programs and settings. Don't bet on this working. Even experts are getting it wrong, see the 1st paragraph's forums. That is also how the free version works. Just avoid this option like the plague it is.<br /><br />2. The other option is 'clean install', which here is only available if purchased. But people who use this, are having really bad luck, and Windows help personnel always blame the seller, so make you go back to the seller. So here, unless the seller sells you support with the license (and they usually do not), then you shouldn't buy.<br /><br />The problem with 'clean install' is the installer looks for a key. The key you are supposed to provide, is a Windows 10 key. The key you get is a Windows 10 key, but the installer often won't recognize it. When you call MSFT for help, often you're told they can't help, you must go back to the seller. So if they are not the seller, you're s.o.l.<br /><br />More importantly, the license is downright frightening. It's so much worse than turning your machine into Big Brother, but Microsoft tells you that you agree to let IT play Big Brother on you, even if you turn off all the privacy destroyers baked into the thing. This is a series of lawsuits waiting to happen.<br /><br />And what do you get for all this? Nothing you didn't already have. Frou-frou that doesn't work: Windows 'Hello' requires a special camera you don't have, Windows Xbox requires Xbox too, Hololens can't work yet, Cortana is a joke, Edge is a gray sheet of paper which gets papered with ads you can't get rid of, your search bar is turned into advertising if you search on the web, you can't get rid of Bing, you can't customize, there is no real Start Menu but instead a vertical version of the Win8 start Screen... and on and on with the nonsense.<br /><br />Oh, and no you really can't revert within 30 days, they overwrite your windows.old folder with the first Windows 10 cumulative update. Which happens, the day or the day after, you activate. IF IF IF you managed to activate.<br /><br />Do you really want to go down the rabbithole with Alice and be much poorer afterwards? I thought not.<br /><br />It gets two stars for two things it does well: it runs old software and hardware which businesses use (not consumer stuff, business stuff).. really well. I use 1980's and 1990's business hardware and software, and Win10 can work with them. Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.<br /><br />The MSfanboy proselytizing is at an all-time high. Which should warn you immediately. If faith is warranted in God or some product, then it shouldn't need salesmen. So if everyone's trying to 'convert' you to it, something's VERY wrong with that idea of God or that product. Right?<br /><br />DISCLOSURE is one thing. That, you need. Selling is quite another, and the fanboys never tell you the many dark undersides to Win10. So...<br /><br />PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE BUYING THIS. Links will be in comments after this review is approved, so you can read the license fright for yourself.n work with them. Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.

ScanSoft PaperPort 11 Professional [OLD VERSION],Software,1,4,4,N,N,Very Disappointing Product - Use the free version instead!,"I have been a loyal customer and bought a full version of PP10, and paid to upgrade to PP11. During the last 18 months, I upgraded my laptop twice, and then upgraded my current laptop from XP to Vista. When I downloaded the Vista version and tried to reinstall it, it says the software cannot be activated. Turns out that they only let you install the darn thing 3 times.<br /><br />THAT IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS IN THIS DAYS AND AGES.

Writer's Dream Kit 4.0,Software,5,84,87,N,Y,Extremely useful if plotting a long fiction is your problem.,"First for Mac users: I installed this on a Mac running OS X 10.3. It asked me which version of OS X I was running and offered 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 as options. I selected 10.3 and it went through a preliminary install. Then it asked for the serial number on the card which came with the software. (If you are as compulsive about throwing away clutter as I am, try to restrain yourself and save that card! Otherwise, I don't think the program will turn on.) After I did this and provided the usual registration stuff, it got online (I should mention I was installing in an administrator mode)and had a chat with the company. Everything went very well. This program is native for the Mac OS X and doesn't require Mac Classic or anything like that. Thanks, guys, for making such a neat piece of software that also runs on Macs! <br /> <br />OK, now about using the program. I am the sort of person who gets a great idea and sits down at her computer and just starts going. Things go wonderfully for about five chapters, and then I run out of steam because I just haven't thought enough about where things are going, and it's getting hard to keep everything straight. <br /> <br />This program is like sitting down with a no-nonsense writing teacher who asks detailed questions about characters, motivations, goals, and so on and gives you feedback on whether or not you have enough information for a workable plot stucture and what's missing. (You are free, of course, to ignore its advice.) <br /> <br />The most difficult part about using this program is that the designers have invented a lot of terminology that you have to understand to use the program properly. (There is a PDF file on the disk containing a 300-plus page book that explains the theory and vocabulary in detail. I strongly recommend you read it first! Once you have that, the software is quite user-friendly.) <br /> <br />What I found especially helpful in the software were the dozens of examples of well-known stories that theauthors had analyzed in terms of their model of plot design. That model(this is oversimplified) is the idea that a story is like a mind trying to solve a problem and that different characters are like aspects of that mind at work. <br /> <br />If you put in the work -- and it is a LOT of work -- at the end you will have a detailed plot outline which can be printed out. <br /> <br />If you can write novel-length fiction on pure inspiration, you will probably hate this. If you have good ideas, but find yourself lost in the woods and hoping for a rescue party after about fifty pages, this can be a lifesaver. You get out of it as much as you put into it.",10/30/2005,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PC-Cillin Internet Security 2006 [Old Version],Software,3,4,7,N,N,Great but eats up memory terribly,"I have just upgraded from 2005 (which I loved) to 2006 with a clean install of 2006 to avoid problems.

It eats up more memory than both of these apps together. My task manager says it is using 69,692 mg of memory just to run in background. I may have to turn off real time scanning to remedy this. What is the use of having the suite then? I have a Dell P4 with 756mg of memory. It has always been adequate to multitask before this. I may have to dump this 2006 anti-virus for another program.

Dragon Premium 13.0,Software,4,27,28,N,N,Hope this helps,"For what it's worth. I bought this to use in transcribing prerecorded interviews. It has a learning curve, no doubt.

Not Dragon's fault but the copy of each interview varied so much in the interview itself and between interviews.<br />Dragon 13 Premium will transcribe downloaded conversations and it's very easy to set that up. But the results can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the recorded material.<br />Now as far as installs, I have three laptops all running either Windows 7, 7.1 and 8. I had no trouble at all installing the software on each and using the one serial number provided.

QuickBooks Pro 2010,Software,3,74,75,Y,N,Minor upgrade to annoying but ubiquitous accounting software,"* The Install * We tested out QB Pro 2010 by upgrading our 2009 Pro install and loading our company file. The install took about 15 minutes and retained many of our settings from QB 2009. The installer did hang at the end hand had to be killed with task manager (Win XP). * First Run * After installing, we ran QB 2010 and it needed to download an update. This process took about 10 minutes, and then it needed to convert our company file to the new format. Not a big deal, but don't try to load a file from QB 2010 on previous versions--backwards compatibility is lost. Actually running the program, we find some minor updates, as well as many familiar old annoyances. The toolbar is again littered with icons for Intuit products we're not interested in (we had cleaned this up when we installed 2009). The Intuit Community pops up, but you can disable it in preferences. The interface is littered with Intuit products they want you to buy. For example, there is an item \\""Email Marketing\\"" in three separate menus, Company, Customer, and Online Services. We tried this menu option and it complained that IE was not our default browser. (Duh, it's called security.) * Summary * QuickBooks Pro 2010 is a minor update (the new company snapshot is nice, the new products they're trying to sell you are not) feature-wise. The software works well enough to tolerate and everybody uses it. Accountants know it. This is why we use it. We wish there was another option for us as Intuit is not a customer-friendly company in our opinion. They try to hard to get you to pay for minor features that should be included. They should spend more focus on the customer experience and let the revenue streams follow, not vice versa.",11/19/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith Micro Software Poser Debut,Software,4,6,7,Y,N,Not quite what I expected,"Poser wasn't quite what I expected. I thought it would be very focused on figures, human and otherwise; but in fact, it's a surprisingly full-featured 3D rendering program.<br /><br />As far as sample content goes, yes, there's quite a lot of it, and it's surprisingly varied. Once I'd put together a quick scene of a wolf eating potato chips, I decided to see whether I could pull in 3D models downloaded from the Internet. Happily, the answer is yes--Poser will read a number of common 3D file formats, so you can trawl the Internet for free models of sci-fi spaceships, Japanese Manga characters, or whatever else you want to incorporate into your artistic endeavors.<br /><br />Obviously there are lots of things you can't do with Poser. It doesn't give you complete control over rendering, and it's not a solid modeling package or NURBS mesh editor. But it'll give you the chance to make some images or animations, and see if you're ready to go further.<br /><br />The thing is, I've toyed with various free 3D tools over the years, from POV-Ray to Blender. Poser has almost all of them beat as far as UI approachability is concerned, and with the sample content and tutorials is an excellent place to start if you have an interest in 3D graphics. Yet even without an unapproachable interface in the way, I've come to realize that 3D is really hard and very time consuming to get just right. I don't think it's for me. But it could be for you, and here's a way to find out.",3/27/2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brain Builder 3.0,Software,5,12,14,N,Y,Works. Takes time but it works.,"I have been using the product for over a month and half and just now am I finally experiencing noticeable results. My ability to hold and manipulate information in my head is better. For example, Math is coming to me much easier. I've noticed that I need to write out my problems less and can finish them in my head. This is great for me because just two 2 years ago I dropped out of calculus but now Im doing fine. Another thing, for the longest time I hit a wall with my reading speed (I bought sofware for that too) but now that is starting to increase once more. The best way to describe it is that things are growing clearer.<br /><br />Now for the bad. The software is very basic. For most, the exercises will probably too boring to do every day. This has been my experience trying to get friends to use it. And in my opinion, ten minutes a day isn't enough. I've been using for about an hour a day. The way I look at it is there will always be a diet that works or a method that gets you rich or a philosophy that makes you happy and there will always only be a few individuals that have the drive to become better. Without being too preachy, this software is for the individual that understands the importance of intelligence in succeeding at life and has the drive to do something about it.<br /><br />Edit: It has been 3 years since using the program. Now that I am aware of what is out there and free websites that offer similar brain training, the price is too expensive to justify purchasing. Dual-n-back, a short term memory training program, has been more effective and more importantly there are free versions available. Another name to look up is Harry Kahne and his coarse in Multiple Mentalism. Both programs are very rigorous but produce results over time.",1/22/2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've also had a number of circular dog chasing his tail kind of things with internet sites that I never saw under XP. My all-in-one Canon printer/scanner/fax will only do printing with Win 7. Using Vista both Print and Scan worked. I use Trellix site builder and under XP I had all the text functions but with Win 7 they are either missing or don't work right. I'm inclined to think the internet sites are right and Win 7 is either wrong or very unforgiving of software variations. The first DVD players failed to work with all discs and the first HD decoders locked up or wouldn't work with some signals. Eventually the range of acceptable signals was widened. Maybe 3 years down the road Win 7 will get there. I have none of these problems with Apple OSX.,8/18/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope his younger brother will be interested in checking this out too!<br /><br />If you're looking for a holiday gift for children in your life that will be more than just a toy, this is an excellent option.

I can't seem to edit the rank to chage it but i can change the text. I am at the point where I have it disabled most of the time because of the way it hawgs resources and slows down the computer. Totally defeats the purpose I bought it for. My original review is below: I bought this due to the good pricing (3 PCs for less than 40 bucks) and the good ratings I saw it get on the review channels (CNET and others). I installed it on two computers so far, and the first thing I immediately noticed the singificant slowdown in booting, connecting to web sites, and email. It appears the program performs tasks at boot up which may lead to web site loading delaying as long as 30 seconds. Also, the second install (second computer) did not work. It caused the computer to crash and I had to reinstall the software completely. I do not know if it counted that install as my third copy or not. My crashes have become more frequent now and I know this is related to the new software somehow. Bottom line, it does seem to catch viruses and spyware well but slows down computer too much, and they don't give you controls to disable certain tasks to speed up operations.

The drawback to Maximizer is that there is little \\""if you are a ________, do things this way...\\"" kind of information. There are basically 4 was to approach the system on a day to day basis, and a user needs to decide which approach is their best one and stick with it. One can manage the information by person (like ACT!) or by Company or by sales Opportunity or by Tasks. These are not mutually exclusive -- you can do all of these things simultaneously, its just best to pick one to be your perspective on life! For example, if your perspective is \\""individual person\\"" then be assured you can start with a person and easily manage all related documents, conversations, emails, to-do items, opportunities, appointments, calls, etc. for that person. If you are managing opportunities, you can likewise easily manage all the people, documents, calls, etc. The most powerful part of Maximizer is that it can fit into YOUR sales process. The most difficult part of Maximizer is that it expects YOU to have the process for it to adapt to. Success with Maximizer is all about having a process.

I copied information I found on the web discussing negative aspects of this copy protection, and included that with my letters, in case these executives needed to know why I was so upset.<br />Perhaps Intuit will respond with a more tolerable copy protection plan when enough people demand refunds, and express their dissatisfaction with the product.",1/26/2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 -Old Version,Software,4,0,1,N,Y,The complete tool for working with photos,"I recently switched to a Mac from Windows, and needed a good Mac program for working with photos. Photoshop Elements is that program. My only problem was finding out how to access each function. I believe Photoshop Elements would be a lot easier to work with if you aren't used to another program like Corel Paint Shop Pro XII. The fact is that Photoshop Elements is a very powerful, complete featured photo program, but it isn't at all intuitive and requires a pretty steep learning curve. Fortunately, Adobe offers some excellent tutorials to help you learn.",1/7/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum [Old Version],Software,3,5,5,N,N,"Very user friendly, until you try to use the CD you created.","For a long time I was an enormous fan of Adaptec and their Easy CD Creator program. The name truly says it all; \\""EASY!\\"" This program is so user-friendly, never crashed on me and never burned me a frisbee. When I purchased my first CD burner it came with version 4.0 (I think that was the version number). Some time ago I purchased the Platinum edition at full price because I enjoyed the earlier version that came with my burner. I installed Platinum and was in heaven! This thing is loaded. <br />Now I know that most of you reading this haven't gotten past my initial remark that, \\""for a long time I WAS and enormous fan...\\"" If you're wondering how a program that seems to be so user friendly, so loaded with options, so stable and so well designed could lose the admiration of a long time fan, I'll tell you.<br />A few months back I purchased a new TDK CD burner. The burner came with Nero 5.0 burning software. I had heard of Nero but was completely unfamiliar with it. I installed it and hated it. It was not half as user-friendly as Easy CD Creator and that part frustrated me. I read that Nero was also loaded with cool features but the problem was, I couldn't figure out how to work them. The help screens in the program were lame and it came with no manual. Frustrated I returned to my Easy CD Creator program and installed it again. Something terrible then happened; neither programs would work right. Things started to crash. I browsed the Net to find answers and discovered that Nero and Adaptec absolutely cannot co-exist on the same machine. This fueled my hatred for Nero even more. Eventually I had to completely re-format my hard drive and start over. This time I installed Adaptec exclusively. But then I discovered something else. My new burner was NOT supported by Adaptec and so nothing worked quite right. I re-formatted again and installed Nero. I was hacked (in the \\""mad\\"" sort of way, not that I was actually hacked, physically or electronically - ok, just a brief point of clarification there for our viewers)! But if I was ever going to be able to burn CD's with my new burner I knew that I would have to learn Nero.<br />To make a long story short, I discovered the joy of Nero! It is a fantastic program and, in my opinion, it's much better than Adaptec software any day! The only gripe I have is that it is not as user friendly, however the options and features are fantastic! You just have to commit some time (and a few frisbees) to figure out what the heck you're doing.<br />But there's more to the reason why I so dislike Adaptec now. Over time I have discovered that a lot of the CD's created with Adaptec do not operate well on all other computers or audio devices. In fact, some CD's I'd made with Adaptec caused Windows to crash when I tried to access them on other computers. Since I started with Nero, and put the effort into learning how to use it properly, it is so much better! I have yet to see a machine that rejected a disk I made with Nero, but Adaptec flopped often. I think the reason why I didn't notice the problems with Adaptec for so long is because I was predominantly playing and accessing disks made with Easy CD Creator on machines that also had Adaptec.<br />Adaptec software has a lot of fantastic features and they are easy to use and the program comes with a great manual! I will say that the VCD maker works nicely and burning a regular audio CD works well. If this is predominately your usage intentions then you will be happy with the program. However, when it comes to making things like MP3 CD's or even just data CD's you may be in for some headaches. Not necessarily if your burning them and using them on the same system, but if you try to use the disk on another computer without Adaptec software, or sometimes even with it, you might discover what I'm talking about.<br />Anyway, all of that to say that there are positives and negatives about this program. Perhaps your experience will be different. I just know that I really dig Nero now! Granted, it was a bit of a headache to learn how to use (and some features I am still learning how to use), but it is very stable and makes perfect copies of anything. You will just have to determine what's more important to you; ease of use or actually being able to use what you created. For me the latter won the coin toss! Good luck!",4/11/2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended,Software,5,0,0,Y,N,Everything including the klitchen sink,"I generally think of Acrobat as a product to make PDF files, but this is so much more.

I had couple times it said that it blocked and removed some threat from attacking my PC. It updates quite often, and I was able to upgrade for free for 2011 version when it became available. For this price and protection, it is a bargain. The security center has all the information at a glance, and it has computer, web, and network protection.

Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate & VideoStudio Pro X2 Bundle [OLD VERSION],Software,5,1,1,N,Y,Excellent for the price!,"The only problem I've had so far is that during activation for the video component of the bundle, you have to enter an organization name in order to proceed with the software installation, since the other components didn't require such an input, i had to call customer support thinking something was wrong with my product key, they told me to just put the letter A in the organization field and it would let me proceed. I used my initials instead and sure enough it worked and continued installation just fine. The whole bundle has been an exceptional value, I unfortunately haven't had enough time to get really in-depth with the video software, but as the interface and \\""demo\\"" projects show, it looks great. Why pay 4-8 times the price for adobe or final cut, this software package is great for beginners and advanced users alike, you can use wizards or create your own components with professional accuracy and claims to support HD, blu-ray, and AVCHD. Again, highly recommended, I wish i could get Corel's Draw Suite for as low a price as this one (I got this on sale for $50) cause i tried the demo of that suite and it was also a great bang for the buck.",2/1/2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,
